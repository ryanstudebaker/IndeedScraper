This is an opportunity to be part of a public company with a great consumer brand and to help Netflix shape the future of entertainment.

Our goal is to bring exciting change to the plate—and Beyond.

WHY you should want to join our team




You like food and you have a deep personal interest in the restaurant business


You like rolling up your sleeves and getting your hands dirty…

…In the office: Sitting back is not part of our mentality. All members of the team, from VP to Analyst, are driven to own their own work products. As Manager, you would oversee the work of part of the team, while still owning some of your own projects


…And outside the office: Working in the restaurant business, we realize the importance of forming and maintaining strong relationships with our restaurants and keeping up to speed on their offerings


You enjoy working in and helping to steer a business through the center of seismic cultural and industry shifts

Dining habits are changing faster than ever before, but casual dining brands still serve billions of meals a year – it is a wide-open race to see who will win those meals


You crave the opportunity to see your projects through from beginning to end

You want to see your work progress past the recommendation stage and come to life in the real world


You want the chance to go back and improve the answer based on that real-world feedback


You take deep satisfaction in the ability to point at something and say “I helped build that”


You like working in small, nimble environments

Our brand headquarters occupies a single floor and so we interact constantly with little or no bureaucracy


Dining is a perishable goods industry – we cannot go back in time to sell yesterday’s meals, so we need to act quickly


You enjoy wearing multiple “hats” – often in the same day

We work with literally every functional area of the business on a regular basis


We work with all levels – Analysts up to the President – wherever we can help out


You are not afraid to be wrong

We put forth hypotheses to get the process moving so our colleagues can react and weigh-in quickly


We iterate swiftly and act as soon as we agree we have a “good enough” answer


You are reflexively Guest-centric

We tend to look at any business problem from the Guest’s eyes first


At some point in our lives most of us worked in Guest services somewhere, and we leverage those experiences and learnings to make our work more than just a Corporate role


You empathize with our network of franchisees and their teams who delight our Guests every day

From large private equity firms to single-location owners who started out washing dishes and have been with us for decades


You appreciate working for a brand with a rich history, yet while it is already deeply ingrained in the lives of millions…

…this brand remains also eager to grow and evolve our place in the dining and cultural landscapes




WHAT we are looking for




Work experience:

Minimum 1-2 years of strategy consulting for a top tier firm or2-3 years in a corporate role in Strategy, Product, Marketing or Finance


Preferably 1-2 years managing teams in a consulting or corporate role


Critical capabilities:

Strong analytical skills and attention to detail


Strong organizational skills


Excellent written and oral communication skills


Proficiency in Microsoft office applications, including: Excel, Outlook, Word, PowerPoint, and Teams


Helpful industry experience:

Restaurant industry


Franchisees and franchised businesses


Product development


Marketing


Financial planning and analysis


Consumer insights


Forecasting


Food / hospitality operations


Food / hospitality real estate development


Personal traits we love:

Curiosity paired with skepticism


Ownership mentality – you see it as your responsibility to ensure things get done and to ensure Guests have the best experience


You take your work personally and hold yourself to high personal standards – you got good grades for your own sake, not because anyone demanded them of you


Comfort with ambiguity – you are able to proceed confidently and efficiently with incomplete and imperfect data


Ability to pivot – when new data comes in or decisions change, you are able to re-evaluate and continue driving forward, even if it may be in a new direction


Mental flexibility – the ability to look at the same problem from multiple angles


Resilience – the energy to keep trying those different angles until you find the one that works better


Structure – the skills to ensure all those iterations make forward progress toward a clear goal


Creativity, storytelling – the ability to wrap the analytical answer into something truly compelling that gives your colleagues the confidence to act
