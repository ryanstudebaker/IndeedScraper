The Strategy & Operations Leader will drive ongoing analysis for continuous improvement, serve as a liaison for digital transformation and change management, and serve as a technical resource in areas of responsibilities. Other duties of this position include: assisting the Clerk in establishing goals, objectives, policies, and the organizational structure of the Clerk’s Office; overseeing the development and maintenance of policy and procedure manuals; analyzing proposed legislation to determine its impact on Division operations and systems; and overseeing and managing the budgetary process for the Division, including the forecasting of future fiscal needs and impacts.

About the job

Strategy & Operations (S&O) professionals in Google’s Marketing organization provide business critical insights and analytics, ensure cross-functional alignment of goals and execution, and help teams drive strategic partnerships and new initiatives forward. Whether you are embedded within a specific marketing team to use insights to enable better marketing decisions or the global S&O function to equip the organization to succeed at scale, you will engage with Google leadership in order to establish Marketing’s strategic direction. You will manage planning and operational processes and work cross-functionally with key partners across Marketing, Product, Finance and Engineering to solve our toughest challenges, advocate for high-priority projects, and drive greater operational rigor within Marketing.



To be successful in this role, you have a hypothesis-driven approach to problem solving, effective quantitative and communication skills, and the ability to take on broad-reaching and ambiguous questions while working collaboratively and cross-functionally with Googlers of all levels.



Strategy and Operations is made up of business thinkers who work closely with Google’s Marketing leadership to set strategic goals and drive business growth. As a part of the Strategy and Operations team, you will engage regularly with leadership to establish Marketing’s strategic direction, getting broad exposure to Google’s business. In this role, you will become a trusted source of advice and an essential partner to executives across our products.

Know the user. Know the magic. Connect the two. At its core, marketing at Google starts with technology and ends with the user, bringing both together in unconventional ways. Our job is to demonstrate how Google's products solve the world's problems-from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can-changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.

Responsibilities


Partner with leadership to set Marketing’s annual strategic plan globally, articulating Marketing’s most critical priorities, and corresponding investment. Develop CEO, CFO, CMO, and SVP level deliverables.


Work across Google’s products to develop solutions to the organization’s toughest strategic challenges and initiatives.


Establish Marketing’s priorities and conduct data-driven business analytics to support and make recommendations on strategy and investment.


Improve efficiency and effectiveness by applying a rigorous approach to Marketing’s operational processes.


Evaluate Marketing performance/impact and make data-driven recommendations for how to adjust our approach to reach our ambitious goals.

Square builds common business tools in unconventional ways so more people can start, run, and grow their businesses. When Square started, it was difficult and expensive (or just plain impossible) for some businesses to take credit cards. Square made credit card payments possible for all by turning a mobile phone into a credit card reader. Since then Square has been building an entire business toolkit of both hardware and software products including Square Capital, Square Terminal, Square Payroll, and more. We’re working to find new and better ways to help businesses succeed on their own terms—and we’re looking for people like you to help shape tomorrow at Square.

RESPONSIBILITIES AND QUALIFICATIONS:


About Goldman Sachs Marketing:

Led by the firm’s first Chief Marketing Officer, the marketing function at Goldman Sachs is backed by momentum and a broad imperative to unify the discipline, helping to codify a business-critical function seen as core to the firm’s future growth. As such, GS is focused on building out a data-and-technology enabled team of growth marketers, delivering value for the brand and the business. The organization will consist of a number of key, senior-level COE roles in areas such as Brand, Media, and Marketing Strategy, as well as senior marketing leads for each of our revenue divisions. Together, this team will collaborate to build a unified, scalable, and consistent approach to marketing the brand and its offerings. Our mission is to be a demonstrable force multiplier for the businesses we serve.

The COO group within the marketing function is responsible for marketing strategy, transformation, and operations, setting direction for the function, partnering with the CMO on their top-priority initiatives, driving collaboration across the COE and revenue division marketing teams, and ensuring executional excellence. The team develops the strategic vision for the function, sets objectives and establishes tenets, articulates and communicates the mission and vision, and acts as the conduit to other leadership teams around the firm. As well, the operations part of the group implements processes and governance, runs the project management office (PMO) team dedicated to supporting marketing efforts, and manages internal and external communications around marketing efforts. As GS continues to invest and grow its marketing team, it is critical that we develop a firmwide approach and process for areas such as budgeting, campaign development, agency briefing and management, tracking and measurement, and knowledge sharing.

This role requires both a strategic and operational mindset to tackle these challenges, as well as the ability to develop ground-up approaches for a new marketing organization and bring together previously disparate processes and teams from across the firm. All roles on the COO team will coordinate and liaise with multiple teams from within the function and interface with senior-most marketing leadership.

At the Obama Foundation, we are guided by a core belief: that ordinary people working together can change history. Our mission is to 
inspire
 those people to take action, 
empower
 them to change their world for the better, and 
connect
 them so they can achieve more together than they can alone.



We were founded by community organizers, so when we seek change, we do it by bringing people together.



That approach begins at home, on the South Side of Chicago, where we are building the Obama Presidential Center. The Center represents a historic opportunity for Chicago: a chance to build a world-class museum and public gathering space that celebrates our nation's first African American President and First Lady, steps away from where he began his career, where she was raised, and where—together—they made their home.



But that approach extends to all our work, whether it's holding leadership training sessions in communities throughout the U.S., bringing local leaders together in countries around the world, working to support the global education of girls, or ensuring young men of color have pathways to opportunity.



As President Obama has said, ""we cannot solve the challenges of our time unless we solve them together."" So join us.

About the job

Google's leadership team hand-picks thorny business challenges, and members of BizOps work in small teams to find solutions. As part of this team you fully immerse yourself in data collection, draw insight from analysis, and then zoom out to develop compelling, synthesized recommendations. Taking strategy one step further, you also persuasively communicate your recommendations to senior-level executives, roll-up your sleeves to help drive implementation and check back-in to see the impact of your recommendations.


The Business Operations and Strategy team offers a working community with a focus on learning and development. As an Associate in Business Operations and Strategy, you will own the problem definition, analysis, work planning, and execution of your workstreams, and become the “expert” on key data/ topics. You will use storytelling skills to persuasively communicate your recommendations to executives, and influence decisions by building consensus, and mobilizing towards execution. Over time, you will build lasting relationships with colleagues across Alphabet, enabling you to execute rapidly with cross-functional support.


The Business Operations and Strategy team at Google plays a critical role in defining and driving strategic, operational and organizational improvements across the company. Also known as ""BizOps"", the group operates like an internal consulting group working on a range of critical projects and issues. BizOps creates strategies for promoting growth of our products like YouTube, Chrome and Mobile. They handle issues around partner development, strategy work in emerging markets such as Africa and India, as well as pricing strategies across our B2B and consumer products.

Have you ever rented an apartment and wished the process could be better? At Funnel we do too. We know we need to make the process of renting an apartment as easy as purchasing socks on Amazon. We’ve created cloud-based marketing and leasing software that delivers the ultimate rental experience for everyone involved in the process. We’re in the process of transforming the real estate industry through cutting-edge technology built, sold, and supported by the most passionate people you’ll meet.

We’re searching for a Strategy & Operations Manager to lead the go-to-market approach to help us scale our core CRM business. You will act as an internal consultant and examine our business and client relationships to help us identify and replicate where we win and what part of the market we should focus on. You will help us generate a playbook for helping our property owner clients to transform the way they do business using our technology with the intention of greatly improving the apartment rental process.

What you’ll do:

Get on-site with customers and non-customers to understand their business, how the pandemic has impacted them

Identify the core metrics that drive our client’s business that we have increased and work with our customer experience team to document those metrics for existing customers and new pilots.

Research how our management company clients are centralizing leasing operations and work with our product & customer experience team to identify a playbook to deliver centralization to new customers

Operate in a cross-functional environment, develop a strong relationship with product, customer experience and sales to ensure success of your priorities

What we think you’ll need:

5+ years of experience in consulting, strategy, biz dev, operations, technology, banking, analytics or related experience; high-growth or early-stage start-up experience is a plus

Proven track record of running initiatives, achieving goals, and succeeding in a team environment

You’ll really impress us if you have:

A JD or MBA

Experience in the real estate business

Experience with SQL

About the job



The Legal Investigations Support (LIS) team handles requests for user data received from Government agencies, courts, and parties in civil litigation. LIS handles a high-volume of these legal requests, processing them through complex policy and workflows.


As a Partner Support Operations (PSO) Program Manager for Legal Investigations Support (LIS), your mission is to hold vendors and partners accountable for meeting operational targets through governance and metrics refinement, ensuring Google remains an effective data custodian in outsourced compliance workflows. When operational problems arise, you will lead the root cause analysis and monitor progress of follow up actions.


In this role, you will work closely with LIS leads to define business needs for outsourcing in light of operational milestones and workflow priority. You will work closely with the training and operational forecasting teams within your silo and with the Quality Assurance (QA) function to execute on operational priorities and drive quality through outsourced workflows.

You are the liaison point between your team and the partners supporting its workflows – you will help lift the operation to the next level of performance. Depending on business need, you will contribute to expanding the operation to new vendors or sites. You manage components of the team's overall operational strategy, including outsourcing decisions, contract agreements, vendor selection and continuous improvements of procedures. In the context of this role, you might at times be exposed to legal investigations involving sensitive personal information or graphic descriptions of criminal activity.

20th century laws don't always solve 21st century problems, and Google Legal crafts innovative approaches for working with some of the toughest legal challenges of the information age. Whether you're a patent attorney, an intellectual property expert or an engineer headed to law school, Google Legal lets you address unanswered legal quandaries and create new precedents. Our innovative services raise challenging questions that demand creative and practical answers. We provide those answers by working at the crossroads of the law and new technology, helping Google build innovative and important products for users around the world.

Responsibilities


Drive operational excellence in vendor and partner management including metrics improvement, process efficiency, supplier diversity, outsourcing strategy, etc.


Be accountable to overall performance of the outsourced operation. Work with Operations Managers to define quarterly goals for our vendor and partner operations, and lead partners through critical changes including new workflows, procedure refinements, and tooling changes.


Conduct regular business reviews and audits with vendor partners and Legal stakeholders. Identify opportunities to improve recurring reporting from partners.


Align frequently with the LIS Policy Team and be able to analyze how a change in policy/workflow will impact outsourced workflows and resource needs.


Deploy robust program management when tracking existing outsourced workflows or launching new ones, creating project trackers, RASCI charts, glide paths, and structured communications to drive accountability and clarity across the PSO program.

The Marketing Strategy & Operations manager will be a key partner to our Marketing Team. This person will engage in strategic planning and analysis for our short form video marketing efforts as well as lead special cross-functional projects to drive business intelligence and KPIs. The Strategy & Operations manager will also help us develop and deploy effective operational models to deliver on our business objectives over the next 12 months.


As an S&O manager on this team, you thrive in ambiguity and have strong attention to detail. You are data-driven and have deep analytical chops. You are a creative problem solver, and can easily substantiate your recommendations with insightful analysis. You are a strong communicator whether you are updating a peer or a senior executive on a major project. You are excited by opportunities to take an amorphous idea and make it into something that is scalable, process-driven, and measurable through critical thinking and collaboration. Most importantly, you are a scrappy team player who enjoys getting things done efficiently, motivating others, and having fun in the process


Client Description:


One thing we know is that this client, as big as it is, is still setting the standard for not only the product they’re turning out, but for the way they conduct business.


Our client is the global leader in technology, with offices in many major cities. As different as those cities are, you can expect that the personality of each office is the same. Commonalities include bringing people together in the physical work space, outlets for creativity (outside work-related exercises), and a setup for brainstorming on the fly, whenever the opportunity strikes.


What they see in your resume, if you’re selected, is your ability to be an autonomous thinker, and a team player; someone focused, and driven to push the envelope who can also let down their guard and have fun with the team while doing it; someone who has the intellectual capacity to challenge even the most innovative thinkers without the hubris that tends to accompany it. No egos here!


Here, everyone is considered a project owner, and expected to give 100%, even when the path forward isn’t necessarily clear.


Work here, and know you’re working with a Forbes #1 rated company.


Work here, and know you’re setting the pace for digital products globally.


Work here, and find the challenge of your career!


And in case you’re afraid you won’t have time for other things, you’ll be able to take advantage of:


Fitness center access


Discounts on things like dry cleaning and oil changes


Free lunches


Convenient commuter shuttles

About Heifer International
In 1944, Heifer International’s founder, Dan West, began outlining a simple but groundbreaking plan to tackle hunger around the world. West, a farmer from the Midwest and Church of the Brethren member, had recently returned from feeding weary refugees during volunteer service in the Spanish Civil War.
He had seen firsthand that giving people food was a short-term solution, whereas providing them with animals offered a steady supply of nutritious food for an entire family.
His philosophy still inspires Heifer’s work today. Partnering with farmers across a range of different livestock and crops, we create unique solutions to local challenges.
Today, Heifer International has operations in 21 countries around the world, working alongside local farmers, business owners and their communities, as they mobilize and envision their futures. Together, we build inclusive, resilient economies, so communities can develop effective ways to end global hunger and poverty in a sustainable way.
To date, we have supported more than 36 million farming families across Africa, Asia and the Americas and in the past five years alone, we have worked alongside 2.7 million families to close the living income gap or set them on a path to doing so. Between now and 2030, we will support an additional 10 million people to reach a living income by scaling up our signature programs. To achieve this, Heifer International relies on its passionate, committed and highly skilled staff.

The New York Times has committed to creating a culture and an environment in which we can all do our best work, including making our newsroom more diverse and equitable and our editorial practices more inclusive. In the newsroom, we are putting in place significant infrastructure to support this work on an ongoing basis — in large part by adding new roles to leadership teams.

The Strategy & Operations Editor will report to a Masthead Editor and partner with the department heads of the visual desks: Photo, Video, Graphics and Design and with the rest of their leadership teams to ensure that the groups function at the highest level possible and continually improve — from the way the journalism is produced day-to-day, to how people are recruited, assigned and developed, to how the report and operation evolves toward the future. A core goal in this role will be to ensure that departments achieve greater diversity and operate more fairly and inclusively for all of their members. While department heads themselves will ultimately be accountable for their desk’s strategy, operations, culture and people development, the Strategy & Operations Editor will serve as a key leader and coordinator to implement and oversee systems and processes, and drive progress.

The Strategy & Operations Editor will also work closely with Newsroom Strategy and the newsroom’s new Culture and Careers group to coordinate across departments and contribute to and adopt new newsroom-wide approaches.

Here are some of the key responsibilities of the job:

Culture & Careers: Shape culture and systems and support leaders across the department to ensure it’s a great place to work and grow. This includes overseeing (and building, where needed) best-in-class practices within departments for recruiting and hiring, performance and feedback, career development and mobility, training, communication and beyond. Shaping, supporting and tracking DEI goals for the department will be a core part of this work.

Operations: Set up, oversee and continually work with department heads to improve systems and ensure the departments operate as effectively as possible and support our journalistic goals -— including journalistic workflow and processes, collaboration and communication within the department and with other groups, department budgets and core logistics. Department operations managers will be key partners in this work.

Strategy: Help the department look beyond the daily report to the small and big opportunities and challenges ahead on the horizon — across areas including coverage, audience, operations, budgets, and beyond — and develop and implement plans to address them.

Newsroom-wide best practices: While the Strategy & Operations Editor will focus mainly on visual departments, they will also play a role in improving newsroom-wide strategy, operations and culture. An important responsibility will be to share and learn from best practices across departments and to identify department-specific issues that should inform approaches across the wider newsroom. The Strategy & Operations Editor will participate in regular working sessions led by Newsroom Strategy and Culture & Careers, who will occasionally call on them to support strategy and operations work beyond their department.

Instacart is the North American leader in online grocery and one of the fastest-growing companies in e-commerce. Since 2012, we've been working towards creating a world where everyone has access to the food they love and more time to enjoy it together.



Groceries delivered to your door in as little as an hour. It seems simple, right? Well, it's more complex than that.

Solving these problems is what helps our customers get back time in their day, so they can do more of what they love.

Millions of people across the world come to Pinterest to find new ideas every day. It's where they get inspiration, dream about new possibilities and plan for what matters most. Our mission is to help those people find their inspiration and create a life they love. In your role, you'll be challenged to take on work that upholds this mission and pushes Pinterest forward. You'll grow as a person and leader in your field, all the while helping Pinners make their lives better in the positive corner of the internet.

As a member of the Business Operations and Strategy team, you’ll drive critical insights for our Executive Team, while also partnering with leaders throughout Pinterest to better align our execution and strategy. With a combination of exceptional analytical and strategic thinking skills, an insatiable curiosity, and an entrepreneurial, “get stuff done” mindset, you’ll play a critical role in not only helping us better understand our product and business to inform our strategic priorities, but also drive cross-functional execution and change that will improve how we operate the business as we reach the next level of scale.

What you’ll do:

Business Analytics & Reporting. Develop a deep understanding of our products and roadmap and how they drive our business to inform important decisions and priorities across the organization. Define critical KPIs and build core operating dashboards to help teams drive operational rigor and manage performance. Be the primary point person with our senior leadership on understanding metrics movements and trends in our business.

Planning & Forecasting. Manage the forecast models for core topline metrics that drive company-wide strategic planning and goal-setting. Work with senior leaders to update their strategic priorities and goals during key planning moments.

Strategic Initiatives & Special Projects. Tackle important strategic questions and business initiatives, and partner with leaders to build business cases for potential investments. Present insights and recommendations to senior leadership, and drive the “follow through” of those recommendations to ensure smooth execution with a diverse array of cross-functional partners.

What we're looking for:

4+ years of top-tier experience. You’ve been a top performer in an investing, consulting, investment banking, product, and/or other highly analytical role at a fast-growing company; knowledge of the consumer internet and media ecosystem is a plus.

Exceptional data analysis skills. You’re a true expert in a variety of analytical tools, including Excel, Tableau, and SQL (and in areas you’re not, you have the growth mindset to learn it). SQL - Intermediate skills required.

Structured thinking + communication skills. You are deliberate in how you approach problems and communicate with stakeholders, and can comfortably converse with audiences as diverse as data scientists, frontline sales and ops employees, and senior executives.

Entrepreneurial self-starter. You thrive in a fast-moving, ambiguous environment, and are independently capable of seeking information, corralling resources, and delivering results without waiting for direction.

High-energy, positive team player. You have a proven ability to build strong working relationships with business partners; this is a highly cross-functional role, so a low ego and a high instinct for collaboration are musts.

In 2019, only 8% of patients had tried telehealth. Today, the pandemic has brought the future faster than anyone could have ever imagined. Now, a staggering 80% of patients plan to use telehealth. But there is a huge problem - 
over 70% of medical conditions still require going to a laboratory and virtual care has no way to reach these patients in-person.

That's why Getlabs brings healthcare companies to you - starting with laboratories.
 For patients, they can book convenient at-home lab appointments and we send a phlebotomist to draw their lab order and deliver to Labcorp and Quest Diagnostics. For telehealth, the Getlabs API bridges the gap between virtual and in-person healthcare, connecting physician-led telemedicine with in-person care from medical professionals. This enables healthcare providers to extend care to the home unlocking high-quality healthcare for more patients at a fraction of the cost.

Our mission is to extend the capabilities of telehealth to treat more complex conditions. The US healthcare system is complex, archaic, and broken. We will need the brightest minds of our generation to achieve our mission. There is a seismic shift and we have the opportunity to build a generational company that redefines healthcare like Facebook redefined social, Alphabet redefined search, and Amazon redefined e-commerce. If you think you have what it takes and you're obsessed with delighting patients, we want to talk with you.

Our team brings together deep technology and healthcare experience, from companies including Uber, DoorDash, Labcorp, Quest Diagnostics, and Y Combinator. Getlabs is rapidly expanding nationwide and is backed by prominent investors including PivotNorth Capital, Liquid 2 Ventures, Tusk Ventures, and more.

Other investors in Attentive include Bain Capital Ventures, Sequoia, IVP.

We work with 4,000+ of the most innovative brands like Coach, Urban Outfitters, CB2, Pura Vida, Lulus, and Jack in the Box. Attentive was founded in 2016 by the co-founders of TapCommerce, a mobile marketing platform that was acquired by Twitter in 2014.

We are looking for someone who can bring a keen analytical mind to solving real, immediate business problems for our customer success team (what we call “Client Strategy”). You thrive when you have wide latitude to investigate open-ended questions, and are able to stay focused amid layers of analysis so as to come up with actionable, digestible insights (and quickly). You are someone who enjoys turning analysis into process, creating net new processes, and constantly thinking of ways to make things more scalable and operationally efficient. You require very little oversight and can take projects over the finish line autonomously. You have plenty of experience working cross-functionally with several stakeholders, and are able to hold senior leadership accountable when information is needed from them. You love working with customer-facing people and supporting their goals.


Responsibilities:

Represent Client Strategy (Customer Success or “CS”) in org-wide discussions of process flow changes, tools/software vetting, and anything that could potentially impact CS downstream.

Be comfortable identifying gaps in systems, processes, and the like, and autonomously fixing and/or improving upon them.

Be able to build Looker explores, familiarize yourself with our data definitions, pull data from the database using SQL, conduct analysis in Google Sheets, and contextualize answers for customer-facing teams and individuals.

Work closely with Business Intelligence and Sales Operations to identify and implement systematic improvements to our data reporting.

Be acquainted with our most used tools such as Looker (or comparable data visualization tool), Salesforce, G-Suite, SQL, Jira, Slack, and Monday.com.

Be comfortable ideating on, and overhauling, existing processes, such as headcount planning, budgeting, compensation planning, and team performance tracking (including benchmark setting) for the entire CS organization.

Own large ongoing initiatives such as account transitions, and proactively recommend ways to improve upon them as we rapidly scale.

Periodically audit and update our frequently used resources to adapt to a scaling team.

Run thorough analyses on critical, urgent, and wide-ranging topics both specific to this team, but also applicable to the broader organization.

Provide insight and clarity into goings-on of the CS team with particular emphasis on account health measurement, ownership of performance metrics tracking, and development of triggers and automation wherever possible.

Do deep, ad hoc analyses for key clients and get buy-in from CSMs and leadership alike.


Skills & Qualifications:

4-6 years of experience analyzing structured and unstructured data with a goal of informing business decisions

Mastery of Excel, SQL, Looker (or comparable data visualization tool), G-Suite, and Salesforce. Ability to conduct analysis solely in Google Sheets is a must.

Strong business acumen. Can find the right data to answer an ambiguous question, craft a thesis, write a narrative, and communicate it to non-technical peers.

Able to hold others accountable and work with many stakeholders including senior leadership, in order to solve critical business problems.

Comfortable constantly learning new software, and seeking out new tools to expand existing processes.

Experience navigating complex workflow processes, tight timelines, and changing teams.

Extremely detail oriented and organized - able to juggle multiple channels of communication and back-to-back meetings.

Experience at startups, in software, and/or with entrepreneurship.


Benefits & Perks:

Robust health benefits packages including access to a 401k and various medical, dental and vision plans, and $100/month fitness reimbursement

Full support for remote work

Daily lunch delivery credit and other goodies sent to home

Regular company-wide social events (even virtually!)

Generous annual education stipend toward job-related external learning opportunities

An extremely enthusiastic team that appreciates collaboration

About the job



Google is looking to help all businesses globally digitize and help find demand online. Part of this is unlocking how Google should engage with businesses across all the various Ads products and where marketing can play a major part in helping these customers succeed. As the Global Strategy and Operations Team Lead, you will be responsible for driving the marketing strategy for how we engage with advertisers externally, and then working cross-functionally to execute it. You will need to be a strategic thinker who is savvy about Google Ads products, and how our clients think about those products in relation to their business.


You will work with the senior leadership team of Ads Marketing, and be a key partner to the Sales and Product leadership teams as well as the overall Google Marketing teams. Your role is part strategy, part operations. You will work with teams and collaborate cross-functionally with key leaders across Marketing, Sales, Finance, and Product to solve our toughest challenges, lead projects and drive greater operational excellence.

You have excellent business strategy and operational expertise as well as business acumen and people skills with the ability to communicate and work collaboratively and cross-functionally with Googlers of all levels.

Know the user. Know the magic. Connect the two. At its core, marketing at Google starts with technology and ends with the user, bringing both together in unconventional ways. Our job is to demonstrate how Google's products solve the world's problems-from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can-changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.

Responsibilities


Lead, manage, and represent Ads Marketing team through annual and quarterly planning, strategy and execution.


Identify and take on ad-hoc strategic projects, everything from defining overall Ads go to market strategy to executing cross-functional marketing initiatives. Bring science and data to help establish team’s priorities.


Work with Ads Marketing leadership team to coordinate executive-level deliverables. Support the leadership team, from managing weekly leads meetings to shaping offsites to ensuring leadership development.


Work with Research and Analytics teams and conduct data-driven business analytics to support and make recommendations on strategy and investment.


Evaluate and pressure test performance. Identify opportunities to drive program growth and customer engagement, and develop data-driven recommendations for leadership. Improve overall operating efficiency and effectiveness by applying a structured approach to operational processes.

About the job

Strategy & Operations (S&O) professionals in Google’s Marketing organization provide business critical insights and analytics, ensure cross-functional alignment of goals and execution, and help teams drive strategic partnerships and new initiatives forward. Whether you are embedded within a specific marketing team to use insights to enable better marketing decisions or the global S&O function to equip the organization to succeed at scale, you will engage with Google leadership in order to establish Marketing’s strategic direction. You will manage planning and operational processes and work cross-functionally with key partners across Marketing, Product, Finance and Engineering to solve our toughest challenges, advocate for high-priority projects, and drive greater operational excellence within Marketing.



To be successful in this role, you have a hypothesis-driven approach to problem solving, effective quantitative and communication skills, and the ability to take on broad-reaching and ambiguous questions while working collaboratively and cross-functionally with Googlers of all levels.



In this role, you will view the strategic priorities across the entire Consumer Marketing organization. You’ll use this vantage point to shape and own various consumer product strategies as well as cross-product strategy, identify opportunities to encourage deeper collaboration across teams, and plug into key company priorities. You’ll develop relationships with senior stakeholders across the team, while also going deep with teams to help drive progress.

Know the user. Know the magic. Connect the two. At its core, marketing at Google starts with technology and ends with the user, bringing both together in unconventional ways. Our job is to demonstrate how Google's products solve the world's problems-from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can-changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.

Responsibilities


Lead Consumer Marketing and cross-Google Marketing strategy projects that inform decisions related to annual planning, investment strategy, prioritization, and other ongoing business priorities, enabling insights and decision-making velocity


Manage a team of people who oversee strategy for various consumer products


Lead initiatives that directly reflect the needs of the Consumer Marketing leadership team


Manage global initiatives that drive alignment and develop projects that scale at a global level


Drive strategic projects across the Marketing organization, partnering closely with product areas including YouTube and business-to-business (B2B) Marketing

The Mayor's Office of Contract Services (MOCS) is a New York City oversight and service agency that manages procurement citywide, from planning and release of agency solicitations to payment of vendors. Annually, agencies procure billions in products and services from a diverse pool of vendors that represent various industries. MOCS therefore aims to ensure that the procurement process remains fair, transparent, efficient and cost-effective.




MOCS makes it easier to do business through use of end-to-end technology tools, increases transparency by publication of enriched data and hosting public hearings, and strengthens procurement operations by providing direct assistance and resources to all stakeholders. MOCS also partners with agencies and vendors to identify areas for policy reform, resulting in ongoing process improvement to reduce administrative burdens and increase the positive impact of services on communities. The MOCS Director serves as the City Chief Procurement Officer.




MOCS team members operate in a fast-paced, collaborative, service-oriented environment, where flexibility and ability to achieve results are valued. All managers lead teams and/or lines of service, assuming increasing levels of responsibility for the organization’s success. Managers align daily operations to the agency’s strategic priorities, engage stakeholders in planning, and drive performance using well-defined success metrics, along with effective people and project management strategies (including but not limited to the assignment of work, maintenance of performance standards, maintaining baseline staff knowledge and professional development). MOCS maintains a lean staffing model, with managers both supervising and implementing tasks within or across areas of responsibility. All managers are expected to deliver timely and quality work products and services, participate in ongoing improvement activities, and proactively deepen their knowledge of procurement and government operations. Managers must serve as principal ambassadors for the organization and are expected to handle confidential matters, promote established priorities, deescalate conflict, and proactively escalate issues along with proposed solutions. Assistant Directors are front-line managers who oversee one or more areas of services and are accountable for the success of an assigned unit.




The Service Desk Unit is part of the Information Technology division at MOCS. The team is both responsible for ensuring that all MOCS stakeholders have access to the most current information and driving best practices related to sustainable knowledge acquisition and skills building. The Service Desk operates a central service desk to respond to incoming inquiries, screens and onboards vendors to technology platforms, maintains learning resources, and implements a variety of proactive communications strategies. Staff aim to provide clear, accurate and timely information to stakeholders, coordinating responses across various operational and technical teams, and documenting and partnering to resolve any issues which inhibit task completion or the overall success of critical initiatives.

Large marketplaces like Amazon have trained us to expect products delivered to our doorsteps within 1-2 days at no extra cost. As a result, millions of sellers on other marketplaces are falling behind, unable to cost-effectively deliver products to their customers. Our mission is to transform the $8-12T fragmented and outdated logistics industry, and build an intelligent, asset-lite network that enables any online seller to offer fast, affordable fulfillment.



Our Team:



How we arrived at Deliverr is different — we are violinists, economists, ex-consultants, journalists, and more. What unites us together is the Deliverr factor: a bias for action, curiosity, and entrepreneurial ownership. We're looking for intelligent, driven, and passionate people to help make our vision a reality. We're based in the heart of San Francisco and building teams around the globe — backed by leading Silicon Valley venture capital firms. If you are excited about joining a people-first company that is driven to power the future of online retail, — we're looking for you. Are you ready?



As a Business Operations & Strategy Associate, you will act as an internal consultant with the ability to execute and affect changes. Reporting to the Head of Business Operations, you will be working on important cross-functional projects such as researching a new market, a new product, productivity improvements or entering a new geographic area. You will have a strong bias for action, an ability to bring multiple internal groups together and drive results.



What you'll do:


Research potential impact of new initiatives through quantitative research.


Define Minimal Viable Product (Experience) for a new initiative, define key success metrics, project plans and resource requirements for success.


Drive the definition and launch of key initiatives by working closely with Operations, Growth, Engineering, Data Science and Finance teams.


Be the sole owner of 1 or more key initiative programs.


Operationalize initiatives after they are successful or move into company operations to lead one of the initiatives.





What we're looking for:


3-5 years of experience including: (1) 2+ years of investment banking, management consulting, or investing and (2) 1+ years in a high growth tech startup.


Proficiency with SQL.


Excellent consultative, communication, and problem-solving skills.


Ability to distill complex issues into structured frameworks and action plans.


Highly analytical, deep experience with reporting tools and ability to pull reports, analyze and get insights.


Ability to thrive in an ambiguous environment with a high degree of autonomy.


Ability to drive consensus across cross-functional teams and influence decision making

What do Airbnb, Slack and Salesforce have in common? They use Culture Amp every day to make their workplaces better, along with over 4000 other companies from around the globe, making up a community who stand together to improve the world of work.



With offices in Melbourne, San Francisco, New York, and London, Culture Amp isn't just for fast-growing startups - we're for every organization that wants to put culture first. By making it easy to collect, understand, and act on employee feedback, we enable People teams to make better decisions, demonstrate impact, and turn company culture into a competitive edge.



It's what makes us the world's leading people & culture platform.



The Opportunity at Culture Amp



This is a truly unique opportunity to join our Business Operations & Strategy (aka BizOps) team, whose core focus is on building up the operating rhythm of the hyper-growth company that is Culture Amp to support strategy execution.



In the past 12 months, BizOps has delivered the company's annual strategy development exercise, facilitated our Exec strategy retreat, developed quarterly strategy and business reviews, and established a daily ""situation room"" in response to COVID-19 where we update leaders on key metrics and progress updates (and anyone else in the business is free to join!)



In addition, BizOps is the go-to team for driving key cross-functional projects for the business. Past examples include our Series E fundraising round, the post-merger integration of our first acquisition, and our long term internationalization plan.



Once you're in the seat, you will:




Work closely with the CFO/COO to lead programs of work that drive clarity, decisiveness and accountability across the business


Build trusted adviser relationships with C-level and leaders across the entire business




What You Bring to Our Camp




You have the mindset of a future COO, and have a penchant for designing pragmatic and right-sized strategy processes as the business grows


You can build high quality artefacts and templates to support and guide teams with strategic prioritization and planning


You make clear, structured communications with Exec and leaders to create a case for change


You are an all-rounder who is excited about taking on unique challenges and projects


You are able to analyze data to draw executive level insights and formulate and own decisions under uncertainty


You are intellectually curious about business, and preferably have an interest in studying how hyper-growth SaaS or growth stage companies operate at scale




Note: Our preference is for this role to be based on the West Coast of America, however we would also consider Australian based candidates.



What we offer



Culture Amp really practices what we preach. We are extremely proud of the Culture we have built, but don't just take our word for it, our Glassdoor reviews speak for themselves!



We want every Camper to feel at home and do their best work at Culture Amp, so we have 4 values that we live by, take a read, and if this sounds like the environment for you, please apply!



We have a strong commitment to Anti-Racism, and we believe in leading through example. Every step we make as a business towards anti-racism is another step we can support our customers in making a better world of work. You can see our current commitments to Anti-Racism here.



But that's not all!




MacBooks for you to do your best work


Share Options - it's important to us that everyone is an owner and can share in our success


Medical insurance - for you and your family so you can feel safe in these uncertain times


Excellent parental leave and in work support programme, - for those families to be


Flexible working schedule - where we can, let's make work, work for you


Fun and inclusive digital, and (in the future) in-person events




Most importantly. An opportunity to really make a difference in people's lives.



Here are a few highlights from Culture Amp

Research shows that while men apply to jobs when they meet an average of 60% of the criteria, women and other marginalized folks tend to only apply when they check every box. So if you think you have what it takes, but don't necessarily meet every single point on the job description, please still get in touch. We'd love to have a chat and see if you could be a great fit.","{'work': 0.006636071828446214, 'business': 0.006636071828446214, 'unique': 0.006437548226732607, 'strategy': 0.005689306543583682, 'bizops': 0.005689306543583682, 'culture': 0.005660856136115944, 'every': 0.004424047885630809, 'airbnb': 0.0043475428595731135, 'slack': 0.0043475428595731135, 'salesforce': 0.0043475428595731135, 'common': 0.0043475428595731135, 'use': 0.0043475428595731135, 'day': 0.0043475428595731135, 'workplaces': 0.0043475428595731135, 'along': 0.0043475428595731135, 'around': 0.0043475428595731135, 'globe': 0.0043475428595731135, 'community': 0.0043475428595731135, 'stand': 0.0043475428595731135, 'together': 0.0043475428595731135, 'improve': 0.0043475428595731135, 'offices': 0.0043475428595731135, 'melbourne': 0.0043475428595731135, 'san': 0.0043475428595731135, 'francisco': 0.0043475428595731135, 'new': 0.0043475428595731135, 'york': 0.0043475428595731135, 'london': 0.0043475428595731135, 'isnt': 0.0043475428595731135, 'fastgrowing': 0.0043475428595731135, 'startups': 0.0043475428595731135, 'organization': 0.0043475428595731135, 'wants': 0.0043475428595731135, 'put': 0.0043475428595731135, 'easy': 0.0043475428595731135, 'collect': 0.0043475428595731135, 'understand': 0.0043475428595731135, 'act': 0.0043475428595731135, 'employee': 0.0043475428595731135, 'feedback': 0.0043475428595731135, 'enable': 0.0043475428595731135, 'demonstrate': 0.0043475428595731135, 'impact': 0.0043475428595731135, 'turn': 0.0043475428595731135, 'competitive': 0.0043475428595731135, 'edge': 0.0043475428595731135, 'makes': 0.0043475428595731135, 'worlds': 0.0043475428595731135, 'platform': 0.0043475428595731135, 'truly': 0.0043475428595731135, 'operations': 0.0043475428595731135, 'aka': 0.0043475428595731135, 'whose': 0.0043475428595731135, 'core': 0.0043475428595731135, 'focus': 0.0043475428595731135, 'building': 0.0043475428595731135, 'operating': 0.0043475428595731135, 'rhythm': 0.0043475428595731135, 'execution': 0.0043475428595731135, 'months': 0.0043475428595731135, 'delivered': 0.0043475428595731135, 'companys': 0.0043475428595731135, 'annual': 0.0043475428595731135, 'development': 0.0043475428595731135, 'exercise': 0.0043475428595731135, 'facilitated': 0.0043475428595731135, 'retreat': 0.0043475428595731135, 'developed': 0.0043475428595731135, 'quarterly': 0.0043475428595731135, 'established': 0.0043475428595731135, 'daily': 0.0043475428595731135, 'situation': 0.0043475428595731135, 'room': 0.0043475428595731135, 'response': 0.0043475428595731135, 'update': 0.0043475428595731135, 'metrics': 0.0043475428595731135, 'progress': 0.0043475428595731135, 'updates': 0.0043475428595731135, 'anyone': 0.0043475428595731135, 'else': 0.0043475428595731135, 'free': 0.0043475428595731135, 'addition': 0.0043475428595731135, 'goto': 0.0043475428595731135, 'driving': 0.0043475428595731135, 'crossfunctional': 0.0043475428595731135, 'examples': 0.0043475428595731135, 'include': 0.0043475428595731135, 'series': 0.0043475428595731135, 'e': 0.0043475428595731135, 'fundraising': 0.0043475428595731135, 'round': 0.0043475428595731135, 'postmerger': 0.0043475428595731135, 'integration': 0.0043475428595731135, 'acquisition': 0.0043475428595731135, 'long': 0.0043475428595731135, 'term': 0.0043475428595731135, 'internationalization': 0.0043475428595731135, 'plan': 0.0043475428595731135, 'youre': 0.0043475428595731135, 'seat': 0.0043475428595731135}"

We do this by making it easier to discover, agree on, and do the things you want to do together.
We're starting with answering the often infuriating question: ""What do you want to do tonight?"" It's tough to figure out how to spend your hard-earned time and money with your favorite people. That's why we're here. When you both swipe right on an idea, it's a match. We’ll handle the rest.
Our content plays a pivotal role in our decision-making platform. Our users love the hand-picked and special quality of our content, and we need to build a team that can scale content innovation and production along with our company. This is where you come in.
What You’ll Be Doing
Develop a vision of what a content organization at Cobble should look like, then build and lead that organization.
Craft a long-term vision for content at Cobble that combines these elements into a best-in-class differentiator for our company. Look for opportunities to leverage content into a strategic moat for Cobble.
Direct a team that can expand content to new verticals, cities, demographics, user preferences and/or situations.
Serve as a champion for content within Cobble, be a representative to the executive team, and collaborate cross-functionally with other departments like the Product, Engineering and Operations teams.
What We’re Looking For
8+ years of experience in content, production, publishing, or entertainment related roles
3+ years in a content role at a technology- or digital-focused company, preference for experience and education background involving lifestyle or entertainment.
Good user instincts - experience working with design, product, and engineering teams
Able to craft a broad vision for an area that’s grounded in/guided by real data. Can identify how content fits into a company’s strategy and larger goals.
Very strong critical thinking and analysis skills. Ability to take an ambiguous problem, use data-informed brainstorming, identify goals and clear metrics, and drive a team to deliver on those goals.
Strong sense of what great content looks like when you see it. Sound intuition of what people prefer to consume; and a sense of how to make mundane and dry material, fun to consume.
Competitive salary & equity package.
How to apply
If interested, please apply with your resume and a cover letter. Our team will get back to you as soon as possible if we think you'd make a heart-fluttering addition to the team.

About Tahirih
The Tahirih Justice Center is a national, non-profit organization that supports immigrant survivors, with a focus on women and girls, seeking safety and justice. Our holistic, interdisciplinary, trauma-informed model for service combines free legal and social services with bridge-building policy advocacy, and research-based training and education. We amplify the voices of survivors in communities, courts, and Congress to create a world where women and girls enjoy equality and live in safety and with dignity. Tahirih’s 100+ employees work from offices in the DC Metro Area, Baltimore, Houston, Atlanta, and the San Francisco Bay Area. To learn more about Tahirih and its work, visit: https://www.tahirih.org/.
Tahirih’s Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Vision and Practice
Tahirih Justice Center centers our work in the communities with whom we advocate, we challenge ongoing oppression and we work to create an inclusive environment that is free of violence, hate and harassment. We acknowledge historic marginalization of multiple systems of oppression which impact individuals at various ways and oftentimes result in compounding levels of harm. We practice inclusiveness in decision making through consultation with employees throughout the organization. Our core values speak to the world we are creating in which women and girls can enjoy equality and live in safety and with dignity. Because we honor the dignity and right to self-determination of the whole person, we are charged with reevaluating how we are best positioned to serve our clients and how we realize this driving principle among our workforce. A culture that recognizes and appreciates diversity, equity and inclusion principles can facilitate effective collaboration, create viable alternatives that lead to greater efficiencies, allow for the emergence of effective solutions, and prevent groupthink through encouraging different viewpoints.
We uphold a multi-directional approach within the organization which recognizes that those who hold positional leadership and all employees are critical partners in developing an inclusive culture. Management must possess diversity, equity and inclusion competencies to lead an engaged workforce. All team members must treat their colleagues with respect by listening to different viewpoints, opinions, thoughts and ideas and embracing a culture of inclusion. We seek leadership that is committed to further develop and expand cultural competencies, dispel stereotypes and build a work environment that is inclusive and based on mutual respect, tolerance and understanding.

Workforce experience is a differentiator that enable Visa’s leaders to continue positioning the company for growth in the years to come. This affords you with a unique opportunity to work on some of the most highly visible initiatives inside one of the world’s most valuable brands. The role will allow you to be creative, strategic and impactful. It will also test your ability to thrive under the pressure of intense expectations and a multitude of critical stakeholders, and ultimately be a rock star in a company where industry leadership is the norm. You will have the unique opportunity to lead the systems strategy roadmap for our external platform capabilities by engaging key customers and being part of a growing business that will scale.

The HR & Learning Systems (Strategy, Transformation, Innovation) organization is part of Human Resources, which under the leadership of our Vice President constitutes an integral part of Visa’s Human Resources organization and reports to the Senior Vice President of HR Operations.



We are a key driver of change through purposeful technology. We are an established, successful global organization. We are a team of experts in our respective disciplines, but more importantly, we strive to harness our collective expertise in the most effective way for the benefit of employees. We combine rigor, data and subject matter expertise with intuition and common sense of what will be most effective for the business. We like to prototype, launch and evaluate. We are comfortable learning from our mistakes.

ABOUT YOU

You drive the strategy around the design of the platforms in harmony to produce an excellent workforce and partner experience. Purposeful integration and simplicity in creating delightful HR & Learning experiences are a hallmark of your record of accomplishment.

You use years of experience in design thinking, HR & learning technologies, product management, data analytics and people leadership to drive change that propels an organization forward. You believe intrapreneurship is a thing and can easily move between riffing on a new approach to engage fintechs on developing scalable delivery models that attract and deliver on Visa-verified solutions.

You have extensive prior experience managing and supporting multiple HR technology products and orchestrating their cohesion (includes but is not limited to HRIS, LXP, LMS, Talent Management, Talent Acquisition, Recruitment, Benefits, content providers and custom platforms). This could be in support of internal employee needs or external business partner and customer training.

You are driven by curiosity about new technologies and tools to enable workforce and partner experiences. Following, collaborating and synthesizing the innovation landscape is part of your DNA.

You are a collaboration expert and successfully can woo a crowd of matrixed stakeholders. You feel deep satisfaction from consensus-building and strive to educate and empower diverse thought partners in your everyday interactions

You love exploring and prototyping new workforce experiences. This could be through partnerships with suppliers to spearheading a HR & Learning hackathon that produces new prototypes for addressing workforce needs.

You have exceptional presentation and communication skills and thrive at delivering clear and concise messages that resonate with all audiences.

Your way of doing people research is by talking to them (often) and capturing the essence of those connection points

You do not need all the answers. You are resourceful, relentless, and resilient, and leverage your skills in asking the right questions to drive disparate resources towards the right answers. You will be working in a startup-like environment within a matrixed organization, this type of work should energize you

You live for figuring out how a new platform works – often stress testing its features and advocating for potential new features you think would add additional value. Leveraging your detail orientation enables you to oversee plans to shape the delivery of a work product and drive large project teams across the finish line

Key Responsibilities:

1. 
Think Big and Dive Deep - Lead small, medium and large-scale implementations including (but not limited to): Key investments in HR & Learning’s multi-year systems roadmap, modernizing our global workforce experience through technology and driving innovation through your innate ability to sense what is meaningful and simple to our workforce:
Set a vision for and use your influencing skills to lead HR technology strategy teammates towards a well-orchestrated and supported program plan that ensures effective launch and implementation

Translate program design into an innovative, technologically forward thinking and operational efficient solution that balances things like quality of workforce experience and operational cost of delivering

Be accountable for the transformational work occurring within the various cross-functional agile teams delivering on work by driving requirements and scope

Act as a strategic business partner to leadership by transforming strategic goals and priorities into a roadmap of business solutions, and then implementing digital solutions coupled with modern and efficient business processes
Operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath you that might live in other HR functions, system development/IT, HR Operations and production support

2. 
Invent and Simplify - Innovate and Grow the HR & Learning Product Portfolio: 
You will have an opportunity to evolve the existing product portfolio and launch new ones. You will leverage your strategic and critical thinking to articulate how the portfolio of solutions you own can evolve into the future. By leveraging your own knowledge of HR & Learning solutions and your vast network, you are able to articulate progressively evolving roadmaps that ensure an integrated workforce experience. Sometimes innovation means completely new ways of thinking and sometimes it means simply delightful tweaks to existing solutions. You operate on either ends of that spectrum and find joy in doing it.
Elicit and document requirements, perform impact analysis and create process improvement recommendations for complex technology projects that touch multiple domains in HR & Learning
Collaborate with IT and vendors to plan, implement, and build the right features / enhancements with a focus on solutions that solve for enterprise, end-to-end HR & Learning processes
Hunt for big ideas that identify and solve important HR problems and move beyond incremental features and instead propose a complete end-to-end automated solution

3. 
Earn Trust - Act as strategic business partner to HR leadership: 
You will skillfully cultivate and grow key internal and external relationships. You will form and engage in productive partnerships with critical internal HR and IT stakeholders – to evangelize the work we do, ensure a common understanding of the experience and scale it effectively across the organization. You will be versatile in the work you do in the context of these internal and external relationships: from ensuring buy-in with a senior internal stakeholder, to negotiating a contract with an outside provider and everything in-between.

4. 
Customer Obsession 
– 
Start with the customer and work backwards: 
You will work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust while having a bias for action. Speed matters and many decisions are reversible and do not need extension study. We value calculated risk taking.
Lead and drive UAT for large technology program delivery
Propose improvements for internal processes with an eye towards automating the manual (reduce all debt)
Provide project management support and communications for complex projects as well as anticipate and raise risks and propose mitigation plans
Use a combination of product instinct, data, and teamwork to ensure we provide well-crafted solutions

Revolut does Operations differently. The team sits at the core of Revolut, working with departments across the business to help solve issues and create effective, scalable solutions.

Operations has been responsible for major milestones like launching Premium and building our banking infrastructure, as well as saving millions of pounds for the business.

Working in Operations at Revolut will give you exposure to a range of different verticals, where you will deep dive into the fundamentals of each business area you work on. This gives you breadth and depth of experience unrivalled in almost any other job and offers you the chance to have a huge impact on Revolut’s success.

ABOUT THE ROLE

We are looking for a talented individual to help us drive global licensing for Revolut but it’s not a typical regulatory job. You will be part of the Revolut’s ambitious strategy to become the world's first truly global financial SuperApp. As we expand our geographical footprint and widen our product offering, the scope and complexity of the authorisations grows as well. You will work across multiple global functions and teams and lead the projects from the business case to the operationalisation of the licences. These will cover our wide product offering (including Banking, Trading, Payments, Insurance and others) and span from key geographies in Europe to new territories across Asia Pacific and Americas.




WHAT YOU'LL BE DOING
Navigate across various licence applications, scope, plan, prioritise and execute the work to obtain licences for new products & geographies
Build and enhance company’s Authorisations framework
Work closely with central and local teams (including C-level executives) on licence deliverables in multiple jurisdictions and across several domains
Hold the pen on Revolut’s regulatory submissions - including deliverables like complete business strategy plans and financial projections
You will be supported by Product, Finance, Risk, Compliance and Legal teams where necessary
Work directly with regulators to respond to queries and address their feedback

WHAT YOU'LL NEED
5+ years’ experience in a consulting, startups, regulatory, banking, brokerage or payments industry background
Excellent team player with ability to work closely with others to deliver results
Capacity to drive complex projects across functions and departments
Exceptional attention to detail
English writing skills, good presenter & communicator
Ability to prioritise workload in line with tight deadlines and work effectively under pressure





A LITTLE ABOUT US

When Revolut was founded in 2015, we had a vision to build a sustainable, digital alternative to traditional big banks. Our mission now is to help our customers improve their financial health, empower them to have more control, and promote financial cohesion across the communities in which we operate. Launching into 2021 with 15 million Personal customers and over a quarter of a million Business customers only reinforced our belief in the vast need across the world for better financial services. As our customer base has boomed in the last year, we’ve expanded our team to match that growth.

WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR

Revolut is being scaled up by people all around the world who share our vision. We’re looking for people who align with our five core values: we believe that we Get it Done because we Think Deeper and are strongly rooted in the Dream Team. We Never Settle hence why we always Deliver Wow. You want to join a community forward thinking people - we are here for you. We believe in empowering our Revoluters in their work, giving them autonomy and ownership of what they do. We want everyone at Revolut to own their story and their successes - working with us means you’re not just another cog in the machine.

 VENTURES



Camelback Ventures increases access to opportunity for entrepreneurs of color and women by investing in their ventures and leadership while advocating for fairness in their funding. By seeking solutions in the genius of undervalued entrepreneurs, our vision is to create livable communities and wealth for future generations to inherit.



Camelback’s flagship program is the Camelback Fellowship. Since 2015, Camelback has raised over $20M and supported 94 social entrepreneurs – 95% identified as people of color and 55% as women. Our Fellows have raised over $50M dollars, have been named as Forbes 30 under 30, and made an impact nationwide in communities from Eastern North Carolina to Seattle.




The COO will report directly to the CEO and will work collaboratively across the entire organization.



THE ROLE



The Chief Operating Officer’s mission is to lead and manage Camelback’s operations team; set and implement an operational strategy and vision for long term success; create clear organizational structures, systems, and workflows that build connections across teams and enable strategic alignment in support of Camelback’s mission, vision and impact.



THE PERSON



The person we would be over-the-moon to work with is excited to add to our culture based on: a deep belief in our mission; a desire for constant learning; a spirit that is unafraid of failure; and an ethic that is humble, yet hungry. The COO will see themselves in the examples below.



You are a strategist who thrives in bringing plans to life
. You love to identify big goals and methodically chase them down. You build systems that help organizations thrive, and live for the moment when you can see what you have built working on its own, regardless of who is using it. You think methodically about the implications of different details, but you do not get frozen in a spiral when faced with uncertain decisions. You strive to build structures that can both meet an immediate need and can also be easily evolved or replaced when those needs change.

You are a passionate culture builder and top-notch people manager. 
Almost everyone you have worked with describes you as consistent. None of them describe you as rigid. You build culture by modeling and expecting inclusive decision making, strong collaboration, and accountability for results. Your team feels appreciated because they have been seen and recognized both directly and indirectly. You embrace feedback as a gift that you give generously and accept graciously because it is critical for growth. You see people as full human beings, always.

You are methodical in setting up structures that promote long-term success. 
You are expert at translating the genius of individuals and teams into repeatable practices and transferrable knowledge. You are both disciplined and patient in managing change, and able to balance achieving near-term goals while building for the future.

You embrace budgets, finances, and data (and probably enjoy them). 
Building a budget and executing against it is deeply satisfying for you. You understand the implications of allocating resources and think deeply about the people affected. You view quantitative data as an essential ingredient in making strong organizational decisions, and you set yourself up to have reliable and valid data when you need it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box! But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.) Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward. So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

Since 1958, IHOP® has been the place where people connect over breakfast, enjoy study breaks, grab a bite before or after sporting events, and so much more. And no matter what menu items they order, there’s one ingredient that’s always constant — a smile. We’ve seen millions of smiles over the years in our restaurants, and now shared in photos across our social properties. In fact, smiles are so much a part of our culture that we changed our logo to include one. This is just one of the many fun and exciting changes you can expect from IHOP®. Because we know the shortest distance between two people is a smile.
