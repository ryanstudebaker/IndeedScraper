About the job

As part of this team you fully immerse yourself in data collection, draw insight from analysis, and then zoom out to develop compelling, synthesized recommendations.

As an Associate in Business Operations and Strategy, you will own the problem definition, analysis, work planning, and execution of your workstreams, and become the “expert” on key data/ topics. You will use storytelling skills to persuasively communicate your recommendations to executives, and influence decisions by building consensus, and mobilizing towards execution. Over time, you will build lasting relationships with colleagues across Alphabet, enabling you to execute rapidly with cross-functional support.


The Business Operations and Strategy team at Google plays a critical role in defining and driving strategic, operational and organizational improvements across the company. Also known as ""BizOps"", the group operates like an internal consulting group working on a range of critical projects and issues.

The team






Risk & Brand Protection (R&BP)



Our reputation starts with you-this belief is core to R&BP Office, which brings together six essential core areas that shape our culture-we collectively work with our businesses to inspire new standards of integrity, trust, and performance to make an impact that matters and to better serve our clients, our communities and our people.

Why Cisco


#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!","{'business': 0.012255405280534357, 'reporting': 0.01083399308009495, 'give': 0.01083399308009495, 'expenses': 0.010503164543140575, 'work': 0.008125494810071212, 'youll': 0.007794666273116838, 'xaas': 0.007794666273116838, 'lifecycle': 0.007794666273116838, 'within': 0.007794666273116838, 'transformation': 0.007794666273116838, 'tron': 0.007794666273116838, 'organization': 0.007794666273116838, 'looking': 0.007794666273116838, 'analyst': 0.007794666273116838, 'implementation': 0.007794666273116838, 'support': 0.007794666273116838, 'across': 0.007794666273116838, 'role': 0.007794666273116838, 'identify': 0.007794666273116838, 'problems': 0.007794666273116838, 'opportunities': 0.007794666273116838, 'provide': 0.007794666273116838, 'solutions': 0.007794666273116838, 'achieve': 0.007794666273116838, 'goals': 0.007794666273116838, 'detailed': 0.007794666273116838, 'tracking': 0.007794666273116838, 'results': 0.007794666273116838, 'analytical': 0.007794666273116838, 'communications': 0.007794666273116838, 'skills': 0.007794666273116838, 'vital': 0.007794666273116838, 'duties': 0.007794666273116838, 'include': 0.007794666273116838, 'limited': 0.007794666273116838, 'quarterly': 0.007794666273116838, 'approvals': 0.007794666273116838, 'requests': 0.007794666273116838, 'capital': 0.007794666273116838, 'reconcile': 0.007794666273116838, 'monthly': 0.007794666273116838, 'expense': 0.007794666273116838, 'vs': 0.007794666273116838, 'forecast': 0.007794666273116838, 'weekly': 0.007794666273116838, 'basis': 0.007794666273116838, 'weeklymonthlyquarterly': 0.007794666273116838, 'unit': 0.007794666273116838, 'metrics': 0.007794666273116838, 'planning': 0.007794666273116838, 'execution': 0.007794666273116838, 'implementing': 0.007794666273116838, 'processes': 0.007794666273116838, 'procedures': 0.007794666273116838, 'building': 0.007794666273116838, 'maintain': 0.007794666273116838, 'improved': 0.007794666273116838, 'analytics': 0.007794666273116838, 'collaboration': 0.007794666273116838, 'des': 0.007794666273116838, 'teams': 0.007794666273116838, 'develop': 0.007794666273116838, 'initiatives': 0.007794666273116838, 'strategies': 0.007794666273116838, 'improve': 0.007794666273116838, 'internal': 0.007794666273116838, 'external': 0.007794666273116838, 'bachelors': 0.007794666273116838, 'degree': 0.007794666273116838, 'related': 0.007794666273116838, 'field': 0.007794666273116838, 'necessary': 0.007794666273116838, 'position': 0.007794666273116838, 'previous': 0.007794666273116838, 'experience': 0.007794666273116838, 'similar': 0.007794666273116838, 'capacity': 0.007794666273116838, 'preferred': 0.007794666273116838, 'must': 0.007794666273116838, 'colleagues': 0.007794666273116838, 'environment': 0.007794666273116838, 'perform': 0.007794666273116838, 'minimal': 0.007794666273116838, 'direction': 0.007794666273116838, 'organized': 0.007794666273116838, 'able': 0.007794666273116838, 'multitask': 0.007794666273116838, 'handling': 0.007794666273116838, 'large': 0.007794666273116838, 'amount': 0.007794666273116838, 'cisco': 0.007794666273116838, 'wearecisco': 0.007794666273116838, 'person': 0.007794666273116838, 'unique': 0.007794666273116838, 'bring': 0.007794666273116838, 'talents': 0.007794666273116838, 'make': 0.007794666273116838, 'powering': 0.007794666273116838, 'inclusive': 0.007794666273116838, 'future': 0.007794666273116838}"

Square builds common business tools in unconventional ways so more people can start, run, and grow their businesses. When Square started, it was difficult and expensive (or just plain impossible) for some businesses to take credit cards. Square made credit card payments possible for all by turning a mobile phone into a credit card reader. Since then Square has been building an entire business toolkit of both hardware and software products including Square Capital, Square Terminal, Square Payroll, and more. We’re working to find new and better ways to help businesses succeed on their own terms—and we’re looking for people like you to help shape tomorrow at Square.

Morrison Street Capital manages a series of closed-end funds investing in commercial real estate. MSC will continue to conduct certain investment strategies through its closed-end fund series, while expanding and diversifying its investment offerings to include an open-end or evergreen fund option featuring periodic liquidity features. These distinct sleeves may serve overlapping participants, but could appeal differently to those seeking traditional real estate risk/return and those using commercial real estate as a higher yielding fixed-income alternative.
Can be anywhere in the United States. The primary responsibility of the Director of Business Development would be to assist MSC in forming new relationships across the country with potential clients who would benefit from investment allocations to the Morrison Street Funds. Due to the niche fund structures and investment strategies of the Morrison Street Funds, the ideal candidate would have more experience raising capital from RIAs and smaller institutional and high net worth investors, and less focus on large institutional pension fund relationships. Qualifications should also include at least 5-10 years of direct business development experience with similar investors/investments. In order to represent MSC in this capacity, the candidate should be well versed in the investment management industry and have an unerring focus on transparency, honesty and accountability.
In addition to developing new business relationships, the Director of Business Development/Investor Relations would collaborate with the existing MSC team including the CEO, the President and CCO, the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and the finance, accounting and reporting team to periodically update firm clients on the status of the funds managed by MSC.
Secondary responsibilities may include developing new relationships on behalf of other business units affiliated with MSC under the Norris, Beggs and Simpson umbrella of companies.
Morrison Street Capital is an equal opportunity employer. Pay is commensurate with experience and offers great benefits package.

Our Background:



Argo AI was founded in late 2016 by industry experts with extensive experience building robotic systems for commercial applications. Our once-small team has since grown into an over 1,000-person strong company with strategic partnerships with two of the world's leading automakers: Ford and Volkswagen.

MasterClass is transforming online education by enabling anyone in the world to learn from the very best. We are deconstructing what makes an actor able to cry on demand, how an athlete defies gravity, and what it takes to write a bestseller. Our online learning content is available to students anywhere anytime, which supports our mission to ignite the greatness in others.



We are a quickly growing VC-funded startup based in San Francisco, with additional offices in Los Angeles. We have created online classes taught by famous masters— Gordon Ramsay, Serena Williams, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Sara Blakely, David Sedaris, Bobbi Brown, Timbaland, Anna Wintour and many more to come.

In addition to partnering with the team, you will work autonomously and help drive projects with the Marketing, Business Development and Content teams and cross-functionally with Analytics, Consumer Insights, and others.



You are a good fit if you are: You are ready and excited to roll up your sleeves. We are a fast-growing, nimble organization and you will be asked to perform tasks with varying degrees of difficulty.

Support critical company initiatives (holiday strategy, analysis for pricing optimization, international expansion, exploring a B2B offering etc.) with problem solving and actionable analytical insights; help identify opportunities to improve core business metrics and to increase efficiency to support hyper-growth




Requirements:




2+ years of experience in a highly analytical environment - top management consulting firm, investment bank or equivalent, and/or tech/ media/entertainment company


Superb modeling skills and extensive experience conducting a quantitative and qualitative analysis


Prior experience in Media and/or Education a plus (but not a must)


Experience in/with Marketing in a highly analytical capacity (also a plus)

We have built industry leading software that allows us to manage our clients' entire portfolio's outdoor services through one platform and one team. Our ideal clients are in industrial, manufacturing, warehousing, and other related non-consumer facing industries.
This position with Olio Group is responsible for developing and maintaining relationships with current and prospective vendors. The Business Operations Associate will work with the Operations Manager and Sales Team to ensure that all services are performed by vendors as necessary to maintain strong relationships with the client. The BOA will, in most cases, spend the majority of their time sourcing vendors for client locations, in addition to ongoing management of each account that they have sourced vendors for. Typical work day consists of outbound outreach to prospective vendors to help them understand the scope of work required, and then onboarding of that particular vendor into Olio systems, followed by ongoing management of that site/account operationally. Olio works primarily with Fortune 500 clientele with their property maintenance needs. Olio works across the United States, so finding vendors and managing them provides a challenging yet rewarding opportunity to make an impact across Fortune 500 real estate portfolios.
The Business Operations Associate should expect to work a minimum 20 hours per week, as necessary, and will report to the Business Development Manager of Olio Group. The Business Development Associate should expect to work 40 to 50 hours per week when necessary to meet the requirements of our clients and vendors.

5-15% of gross profits on managed sites

Amount paid to Business Operations Associate managing $2,000,000-$4,000,000 will range between about $50,000-$100,000 annually.

It is estimated that 15% of all health care encounters worldwide result in a diagnostic error. In the US alone, more than 12 million errors costing over $750 billion a year are made. The most common errors are missed cancers and heart disease, the top two causes of death. The problem has gotten so bad that the National Academy of Medicine now predicts that everyone will experience a diagnostic error and the World Health Organization considers it a very top priority.
We aim to improve early disease detection and improve diagnosis by focusing on improving the accuracy and completeness of automated and highly personalized patient-reported data collection, assessment, and documentation that is scalable and clinically proven to work. Our application harnesses the intimacy of the human voice and the power of animation in the form of a full-bodied digital human to engage and entertain, while collecting, risk assessing, and documenting complex medical answers to help our health system and physician clients provide better care with increased productivity.
As our first Director of Strategy & Business Development, you'll help further our mission and reach by securing new business relationships with key health systems and physicians. This is a cross-functional and collaborative role that will have a tremendous impact on our business and the digital health industry as a whole. Join us!
This role will report to our CEO and can be remote anywhere in the US.
As the Director of Strategy & Business Development, you will: 
· Secure new business relationships with health systems and physicians
· Design and negotiate novel partnerships/deal structures to accomplish business objectives
· Partner with diverse digital health companies with synergistic offerings to develop new capabilities required to deliver on new business relationships
· Support or lead on strategic growth initiatives for the business
To be successful in this role, you have to: 
· Have extensive knowledge about the US healthcare system, particularly physicians and health systems, through at least 5 years experience with business development, sales, and or marketing to physicians
· Have experience working cross-functionally to deliver against business objectives
· Have strong and effective written and verbal communication
· Have a strategic mindset with the ability to see and structure problems at a high level and guide team members through complex situations
· To be a self-starter and driver who consistently meets or exceeds revenue goals as a result of focused account development and sales efforts, strong understanding of SOAP Health’s products and business model, and by providing a professional level of client service, account management, industry business, and digital acumen.
· To actively and productively work with the SOAP Health team and management to offer ideas to improve current offerings and platforms and potential new areas of revenue growth.
· Bonus - Experience selling a software product or securing and developing new partnerships in health systems and physicians.
Because we are on a mission to help hundreds of millions worldwide, we believe it’s essential to reflect the diversity of those we intend to serve. We’re an equal opportunity employer dedicated to building a culturally and experientially diverse team that leads with empathy and respect.

RESPONSIBILITIES AND QUALIFICATIONS:


About Goldman Sachs Marketing:

Led by the firm’s first Chief Marketing Officer, the marketing function at Goldman Sachs is backed by momentum and a broad imperative to unify the discipline, helping to codify a business-critical function seen as core to the firm’s future growth. As such, GS is focused on building out a data-and-technology enabled team of growth marketers, delivering value for the brand and the business. The organization will consist of a number of key, senior-level COE roles in areas such as Brand, Media, and Marketing Strategy, as well as senior marketing leads for each of our revenue divisions. Together, this team will collaborate to build a unified, scalable, and consistent approach to marketing the brand and its offerings. Our mission is to be a demonstrable force multiplier for the businesses we serve.

The COO group within the marketing function is responsible for marketing strategy, transformation, and operations, setting direction for the function, partnering with the CMO on their top-priority initiatives, driving collaboration across the COE and revenue division marketing teams, and ensuring executional excellence. The team develops the strategic vision for the function, sets objectives and establishes tenets, articulates and communicates the mission and vision, and acts as the conduit to other leadership teams around the firm. As well, the operations part of the group implements processes and governance, runs the project management office (PMO) team dedicated to supporting marketing efforts, and manages internal and external communications around marketing efforts. As GS continues to invest and grow its marketing team, it is critical that we develop a firmwide approach and process for areas such as budgeting, campaign development, agency briefing and management, tracking and measurement, and knowledge sharing.

This role requires both a strategic and operational mindset to tackle these challenges, as well as the ability to develop ground-up approaches for a new marketing organization and bring together previously disparate processes and teams from across the firm. All roles on the COO team will coordinate and liaise with multiple teams from within the function and interface with senior-most marketing leadership.

About RLC
Rescuing Leftover Cuisine (RLC) is a nonprofit organization committed to fighting food insecurity and preventing food waste.

Despite the limitations and disastrous impact of COVID-19, RLC has been working harder than ever to overcome new challenges and ensure our community remains strong and diligent in the fight against food waste and food insecurity.

We launch our own brands, we invest in supporting technology, we partner with other high potential DTC brands on a revenue and/or equity share basis - real skin in the game brings true partnership. Regardless of how we work the goal remains the same - grow really, really fast but ensure that everyone in the team is having a great time every step of the way.

The Founder



The GS team brings extensive experience in the rapid growth DTC space. Our founder Mark Patchett has driven over $1B in revenue, including scaling Nectar Sleep to be the #1 fastest growing 2018 ecom in the USA ($10M -> $240M). Our Chief Growth Officer, Gavin Conway, founded the internal growth accelerator at Omnicom and ran performance marketing for AirBnB in Europe, alongside a host of other prominent scale-up brands including BlaBlaCar, Zopa and Nutmeg.



As for GS specifically, we launched our first portfolio of brands last January after partnering with a business that turned over $1M p/a. We closed 2020 at $30M/$68.5M run rate. We’ll close 2021 at $150M through scale and acquisition with 2022 set for $300M.

The Role


This will be a fun and super high impact role all focused on new business and deals. Our unique structure allows us to take on a few types of deal structures:



Advisory clients:
 these are part or full service clients (all focused on Growth Marketing), including but not limited to strategy, paid media, CRM, design, content, email and data). Our target here is £20k/$25k monthly retainers.

Skin in the game: 
here we offer the same type of services as with advisory but we have skin in the game through profit/revenue/equity incentive.

Acquisition: 
these are deals where we own a significant, or majority non vesting share in a company. We become both the agency and the client.

What we’re looking for



We need someone to hunt down amazing deals for us and drive $5M in new revenue.

You’ll love every part of the process, from sourcing through to closing

You’ll have a great existing network that you can tap into as well as highly systematized approaches for driving fresh leads

Who we’re looking for



You’ve done this for 5+ years specifically in the growth/marketing world

You know your close rate and funnel performance

You fuel your own motivation and are a self manager

You love to mentor and lift the overall team performance

You have massive ambitions

You think like a growth hacker with unconventional approaches to solving problems

You’re flexible working across multiple time zones

You welcome constructive criticism and offer the same

You’re 
not
 a traditional 9-5 type

You get that life shouldn’t be too serious

Inclusion



At Growth Shop we pride ourselves on being an inclusive employer and warmly welcome LGBTQIA+ people, people of colour, neurodivergent people, parents and individuals with impairments to apply to work with us. We recognise the value of having diverse perspectives within our teams and welcome these with open arms and a commitment to fostering a work environment that supports and empowers all voices.

We are committed to making reasonable adjustments to the recruitment process as required. We also hope that you will feel comfortable notifying our team of your pronouns at any stage of the recruitment process. Please add any such notifications or adjustment requests to your application.","{'building': 0.005701352879631878, 'something': 0.005701352879631878, 'little': 0.005701352879631878, 'different': 0.005701352879631878, 'launch': 0.005701352879631878, 'invest': 0.005701352879631878, 'supporting': 0.005701352879631878, 'technology': 0.005701352879631878, 'partner': 0.005701352879631878, 'potential': 0.005701352879631878, 'andor': 0.005701352879631878, 'equity': 0.005701352879631878, 'basis': 0.005701352879631878, 'real': 0.005701352879631878, 'true': 0.005701352879631878, 'partnership': 0.005701352879631878, 'regardless': 0.005701352879631878, 'goal': 0.005701352879631878, 'remains': 0.005701352879631878, 'grow': 0.005701352879631878, 'fast': 0.005701352879631878, 'ensure': 0.005701352879631878, 'everyone': 0.005701352879631878, 'step': 0.005701352879631878, 'way': 0.005701352879631878, 'extensive': 0.005701352879631878, 'experience': 0.005701352879631878, 'rapid': 0.005701352879631878, 'space': 0.005701352879631878, 'mark': 0.005701352879631878, 'patchett': 0.005701352879631878, 'driven': 0.005701352879631878, 'scaling': 0.005701352879631878, 'nectar': 0.005701352879631878, 'sleep': 0.005701352879631878, 'fastest': 0.005701352879631878, 'growing': 0.005701352879631878, 'ecom': 0.005701352879631878, 'usa': 0.005701352879631878, 'chief': 0.005701352879631878, 'officer': 0.005701352879631878, 'gavin': 0.005701352879631878, 'conway': 0.005701352879631878, 'founded': 0.005701352879631878, 'internal': 0.005701352879631878, 'accelerator': 0.005701352879631878, 'omnicom': 0.005701352879631878, 'ran': 0.005701352879631878, 'airbnb': 0.005701352879631878, 'europe': 0.005701352879631878, 'alongside': 0.005701352879631878, 'host': 0.005701352879631878, 'prominent': 0.005701352879631878, 'scaleup': 0.005701352879631878, 'blablacar': 0.005701352879631878, 'zopa': 0.005701352879631878, 'nutmeg': 0.005701352879631878, 'launched': 0.005701352879631878, 'first': 0.005701352879631878, 'portfolio': 0.005701352879631878, 'last': 0.005701352879631878, 'january': 0.005701352879631878, 'partnering': 0.005701352879631878, 'turned': 0.005701352879631878, 'pa': 0.005701352879631878, 'closed': 0.005701352879631878, 'run': 0.005701352879631878, 'scale': 0.005701352879631878, 'set': 0.005701352879631878, 'fun': 0.005701352879631878, 'super': 0.005701352879631878, 'impact': 0.005701352879631878, 'unique': 0.005701352879631878, 'structure': 0.005701352879631878, 'allows': 0.005701352879631878, 'take': 0.005701352879631878, 'types': 0.005701352879631878, 'deal': 0.005701352879631878, 'structures': 0.005701352879631878, 'full': 0.005701352879631878, 'service': 0.005701352879631878, 'limited': 0.005701352879631878, 'strategy': 0.005701352879631878, 'paid': 0.005701352879631878, 'media': 0.005701352879631878, 'crm': 0.005701352879631878, 'design': 0.005701352879631878, 'content': 0.005701352879631878, 'email': 0.005701352879631878, 'data': 0.005701352879631878, 'target': 0.005701352879631878, 'monthly': 0.005701352879631878, 'retainers': 0.005701352879631878, 'services': 0.005701352879631878, 'profitrevenueequity': 0.005701352879631878, 'incentive': 0.005701352879631878, 'significant': 0.005701352879631878, 'majority': 0.005701352879631878, 'non': 0.005701352879631878, 'vesting': 0.005701352879631878}"

Since early 2020, the best minds in business have taught over 10,000 students strategic frameworks that have upleveled their thinking and accelerated their career - all this without the friction of business school applications and at a fraction of the cost. If you’re interested in joining a fast-paced education startup making a meaningful impact in the world, join us at Section4.

We are looking for a scrappy, research-minded analyst to join our Strategy & Business Operations. You’ll be our first full-time hire dedicated to strategy & biz ops and use primary and secondary research to analyze new markets, verticals, and business models for Section4. As a 
Business Analyst,
 you will get in the weeds to creatively analyze potential opportunities, then synthesize this research into recommendations. You’ll also support more ad-hoc research and business planning requests as well as fundraising.

This is a remote position based in the US.





What you’ll do

Use primary and secondary research (i.e. consumer research, desk research, expert calls, TAM analysis) to support the development and go-to-market for Section4’s near- and long-term strategy.

Synthesize data and research findings into insightful recommendations for the bus ops and leadership teams.

Support fundraising and investment memos for the company including research, analysis, and deck building.

Serve as an internal research resource for the leadership team, handling ad-hoc requests for quick, scrappy analyses and Excel models.

Own and report company-wide KPIs across the business functions.

Work cross-functionally across the organization, partnering with product, marketing, academics, membership and other teams on a variety of growth-focused projects

Partner with the leadership and marketing teams to develop Section4 thought leadership (written and via slide decks).


Who you are

3+ years of experience in a highly analytical and strategic role that requires synthesizing research and analysis into recommendations; candidates with experience in strategy and/or business operations at fast growing Series A/B companies are encouraged to apply.

Experience building business models and analyzing data in Excel/Google Sheets. (proficiency in SQL is also preferred)

A strong writer and presenter who’s equally at home writing a brief or creating a slide deck.

You have a knack for finding creative or unusual research/data sources to solve a problem or answer a question, as you won’t have many internal research databases/dashboards at your disposal.

You’re intellectually curious and incredibly detail-oriented, with a penchant for over delivering on tight deadlines.

You can balance speed with thoroughness to get to high fidelity analysis quickly.

You thrive with the ambiguity and responsibility required in high growth startups.

You’re passionate about making access to business education more accessible and affordable.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.


We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!


But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)


Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

About the job

Strategy & Operations (S&O) professionals in Google’s Marketing organization provide business critical insights and analytics, ensure cross-functional alignment of goals and execution, and help teams drive strategic partnerships and new initiatives forward. Whether you are embedded within a specific marketing team to use insights to enable better marketing decisions or the global S&O function to equip the organization to succeed at scale, you will engage with Google leadership in order to establish Marketing’s strategic direction. You will manage planning and operational processes and work cross-functionally with key partners across Marketing, Product, Finance and Engineering to solve our toughest challenges, advocate for high-priority projects, and drive greater operational rigor within Marketing.



To be successful in this role, you have a hypothesis-driven approach to problem solving, effective quantitative and communication skills, and the ability to take on broad-reaching and ambiguous questions while working collaboratively and cross-functionally with Googlers of all levels.

Know the user. Know the magic. Connect the two. At its core, marketing at Google starts with technology and ends with the user, bringing both together in unconventional ways. Our job is to demonstrate how Google's products solve the world's problems-from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can-changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.

Responsibilities


Partner with leadership to set Marketing’s annual strategic plan globally, articulating Marketing’s most critical priorities, and corresponding investment. Develop CEO, CFO, CMO, and SVP level deliverables.


Work across Google’s products to develop solutions to the organization’s toughest strategic challenges and initiatives.


Establish Marketing’s priorities and conduct data-driven business analytics to support and make recommendations on strategy and investment.


Improve efficiency and effectiveness by applying a rigorous approach to Marketing’s operational processes.

Millions of people across the world come to Pinterest to find new ideas every day. It's where they get inspiration, dream about new possibilities and plan for what matters most. Our mission is to help those people find their inspiration and create a life they love. In your role, you'll be challenged to take on work that upholds this mission and pushes Pinterest forward. You'll grow as a person and leader in your field, all the while helping Pinners make their lives better in the positive corner of the internet.

Advertisers on Pinterest play a big role in providing the content that helps people discover and save the things they love. We’re looking for a motivated self-starter to establish strategy, execute operational improvements, and generate data driven insights for the Customer Success team. With the goal to help our global advertisers, big and small, get discovered by millions of people looking for things to plan, buy, and do. You’ll work directly with Customer Success leadership on improving our operational scale in the US and abroad. You’ll find data driven insights and make strategic recommendations to improve our operations and service, and work directly with our Global Sales and Services teams to help make Pinterest even better.

What you’ll do:

Advise leadership on ways to improve our operational strategy

Identify operational pain points; use data to size, prioritize and recommend at-scale strategic solutions

Mine data to find insights on the performance of the Customer Success team, our advertisers, and our sellers

Partner with cross functional teams, sales, service and product to facilitate successful conceptualization and execution of product and program launches

Recommend processes changes, systems, and workflow automation to improve the Pinterest services offered to advertisers

What we’re looking for:

Senior presence, ability to clearly and consistently work side-by-side across functions and departments synthesizing multiple points of view into a coherent action plan.

Ability to manage through ambiguous and subjective situations, including balancing strategic orientation and operational efficiency to ensure we deliver what is “right” for the customer.

Analytical and process-oriented, comfortable working with data and making data-driven decisions. Ability to think both creatively and critically, willing to think outside the box and challenge the status quo.

Skills needed: metrics creation, data manipulation & modeling (Excel, Tableau, SQL), understanding of how data is transferred, transformed and reported out (BI, Product Data tables & ETLs), able to leverage those data insights to build business cases and compelling strategic narratives.

Passion for Pinterest’s mission, supporting businesses and improving the users experience.

As a modernized technology company, our Slalom Technologists are disrupting the market and bringing to life the art of the possible for our clients. We have passion for building strategies, solutions and creative products to help our clients solve their most complex and interesting business problems. We surround our technologists with interesting challenges, innovative minds and emerging technologies.

We’re embedded in the Atlanta community, and we get to work with Atlanta’s Fortune 500 and mid-market enterprises, NGO’s using the latest technology to realize their visions

We collaborate with our Slalom colleagues, our partners, our community, and our clients on opportunities we couldn’t have imagined

With mentoring and coaching at the heart of our practice we get to take budding architects under our wings and help them realize their vision of being an Enterprise Operations Architect

Best of all, we’re forced to grow, and we're continuously challenged as technologies and our clients evolve ever faster.

What You’ll Do

Formulate strategies that establish and enable our clients’ business goals, driving top or bottom-line growth

Create broad-based enterprise-wide that lead to business-unit level strategies

Bridge the gap that often exists between business units (business, IT, data) to drive meaningful outcomes that align to solutions across people, processes, technology, and information

What You’ll Bring

An understanding of the role technology plays in business strategy development, adoption
,
 and execution.

Knowledge of various strategies, architectures (including capabilities, maturity level, gaps), and operating business environments from both an internal and external perspective

Awareness of design strategies that will drive our client outcomes and position our clients for success

Just being smart, having some certs, and being able to rattle off a bunch of key operations concepts won’t cut it. Slalom Business Strategists need to be able to establish credibility from the first meeting and continue to grow the client’s trust. They must bring together business and technology leaders and practitioners to frame a clear enterprise vision, a strategy to achieve it, and a road map to get there. They need to drive effective collaboration across disciplines, partners, and client business and technology groups to deliver that road map.

Feel like you’re on the path to becoming a Business Strategist, but you’re not quite there yet? We’d love to chat with you to see if we can take you from where you are today and grow you into a Slalom Business Strategist.

About Us:



Warby Parker was founded with a mission: to inspire and impact the world with vision, purpose, and style.



We're constantly asking ourselves how we can do more and make a greater impact—and that starts by reimagining everything that a company and industry can be. We want to demonstrate that a business can scale, be profitable, and do good in the world—without charging a premium for it. And we've learned that it takes creativity, empathy, and innovation to achieve that goal.



Since the day we launched in 2010, we've pioneered ideas, designed products, and developed technologies that help people see. We offer everything our customers need for happier eyes at a price that leaves them with money in their pockets, from designer-quality glasses and contacts to eye exams and vision tests.



Ultimately, we believe in vision for all, which is why for every pair of glasses or sunglasses we sell, a pair of glasses is distributed to someone in need through our Buy a Pair, Give a Pair program. Over eight million pairs of glasses have been distributed in over 50 countries; that means eight million people now have the glasses they need to learn, work, and achieve better economic outcomes.



At Warby Parker, you can look forward to company outings and events, volunteering and learning opportunities, and just great company filled with curious, kind folks. Dreaming up and sharing ideas aren't responsibilities reserved for certain teams or leaders; the challenge (a really fun one) of innovation is on all of our shoulders. Teammates can also connect around common interests, backgrounds, and identities, no matter their home base, through our various employee resource groups. (We're happy to say that the Human Rights Campaign has named us a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ+ employees!) That sense of community and belonging keeps us excited to walk through the door every day, wherever that door may be.



We're driven to continue building a workplace, based on inclusive behaviors and equitable systems, where all employees can bring their authentic selves, feel engaged, and share their perspectives as a valued member of Team Warby.

In keeping with our beliefs and goals, no employee or applicant will face discrimination/harassment based on: race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, age, gender, marital domestic partner status, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability status, or veteran status. Above and beyond discrimination/harassment based on 'protected categories,' we also strive to prevent other, subtler forms of inappropriate behavior (e.g., stereotyping) from ever gaining a foothold in our office. Whether blatant or hidden, barriers to success have no place in our workplace.

The Clerk’s Office is the state’s central filing office for corporations, limited partnerships, limited liability companies, and Uniform Commercial Code liens.

The Strategy & Operations Leader will oversee the Customer Contact Center, Clerk’s Information System (CIS) Processing, Commission case filings, and the Legal Examination process. Additional areas of oversight include Administrative Services, which encompasses internal and external court services, the administration and fiscal sections, the SCC mailroom, and the copy center. The Strategy & Operations Leader will drive ongoing analysis for continuous improvement, serve as a liaison for digital transformation and change management, and serve as a technical resource in areas of responsibilities. Other duties of this position include: assisting the Clerk in establishing goals, objectives, policies, and the organizational structure of the Clerk’s Office; overseeing the development and maintenance of policy and procedure manuals; analyzing proposed legislation to determine its impact on Division operations and systems; and overseeing and managing the budgetary process for the Division, including the forecasting of future fiscal needs and impacts.

Throughout the second half of 2021 and in 2022 we'll be launching 100s of travel experiences across multiple music genres with a particular emphasis on Latin, Electronic music and Hip Hop, as well as new verticals, including fitness. We have already launched experiences with several award-winning artists and partners across multiple genres, including Justin Bieber, J Balvin, Ozuna, and Brett Young.



Our team's mission: ""Become a centre-of-excellence for understanding the customer, turning it into best-in-class, customer-led content strategy."" 
Our team is responsible for developing the strategy that underpins these experiences both at an individual experience-level but also holistically, building a 12-36 month content strategy, where the ""content"" is highly curated music and travel experiences.



With such ambitious growth, it's crucial that we develop a robust content strategy to ensure we become known for being the leading marketplace for the best shared experiences for young people, and this role will be the engine driving that strategy. You will be passionate about music and travel, and excited about the potential for Pollen to transform the experiences industry.



In the first 12 months you will:




Support senior team members to define and continuously improve our Content Strategy

We think of our Content Strategy as living and breathing. In this role, you will work with senior team members to define our approach to content strategy, as well as working with our Market Research team to continuously improve our understanding of the types of content our customers want using various methods e.g., testing, market research, etc.

This will require significant cross-functional collaboration to ground the content strategy in the business. While initially you will work with a senior team member to do this, the expectation is soon you will be owning and driving relationships on your own.


Work with our Content team to build artist-led experiences for million dollar campaigns

When we are working with a partner e.g., J Balvin, we will use insights, both qualitative and quantitative, to curate an unforgettable experience. In this role, you will work cross-functionally to build our initial valuation of that experience, which involves building an evidence-led view of the partner's customer base to determine the right pricing, destination, and experience for that customer.


Launch the next must-attend experience

At Pollen we are working hard for our USP to become how well we leverage insights that no one else has to build our own experiences or ""concepts."" We most recently launched a 90s hip-hop and R&B experience in Cancun called Golden Sands. You will be part of a team that is responsible for generating a high volume of creative concepts for curated travel experiences. You will work with a senior team member, our creative team and our Insights team to drive these concepts from ideation to launch.


Excel at stakeholder management

In this role, you will be expected to work across multiple teams. Initially, you will be supported by a senior team member, but over time you would grow to at any one point leading multiple cross-functional projects.


Contribute to the team culture

As we look to build out our team, it's critical that every team member play a role in building the team culture. Every person on the team has an ""extra 10"" role e.g., organising team activities, coordinating our goal-setting process, owning our weekly team pulse checks.


About our culture


We are results focused so you can choose your own hours & take as much vacation as you need to drive results and perform at your best. Watch our CEO talk about our innovative culture.


Read our CEO's open letter about our focus on Belonging, and about the mission of our women's programme Illuminate.

Large marketplaces like Amazon have trained us to expect products delivered to our doorsteps within 1-2 days at no extra cost. As a result, millions of sellers on other marketplaces are falling behind, unable to cost-effectively deliver products to their customers. Our mission is to transform the $8-12T fragmented and outdated logistics industry, and build an intelligent, asset-lite network that enables any online seller to offer fast, affordable fulfillment.



Our Team:



How we arrived at Deliverr is different — we are violinists, economists, ex-consultants, journalists, and more. What unites us together is the Deliverr factor: a bias for action, curiosity, and entrepreneurial ownership. We're looking for intelligent, driven, and passionate people to help make our vision a reality. We're based in the heart of San Francisco and building teams around the globe — backed by leading Silicon Valley venture capital firms. If you are excited about joining a people-first company that is driven to power the future of online retail, — we're looking for you. Are you ready?



As a Business Operations & Strategy Associate, you will act as an internal consultant with the ability to execute and affect changes. Reporting to the Head of Business Operations, you will be working on important cross-functional projects such as researching a new market, a new product, productivity improvements or entering a new geographic area. You will have a strong bias for action, an ability to bring multiple internal groups together and drive results.



What you'll do:


Research potential impact of new initiatives through quantitative research.


Define Minimal Viable Product (Experience) for a new initiative, define key success metrics, project plans and resource requirements for success.


Drive the definition and launch of key initiatives by working closely with Operations, Growth, Engineering, Data Science and Finance teams.


Be the sole owner of 1 or more key initiative programs.

SMB Capital, in a “JV” (joint venture) with Kershner Trading Group in NYC, is looking for experienced US Equities Traders with a strong track record, who seek capital and technology to build their trading business while maintaining the autonomy of working from a remote location while being connected to a team of high performing traders. Our technology will help you play more offense and make more PnL: proprietary execution platform, custom filters, single stock scripts and automated trading.


The SMB Capital - Kershner Trading Group JV provides all capital and a PnL firm infrastructure to traders, who actively trade stock instruments in financial markets. Traders share the profits from their trading activity with the firm. Each trader sets their own style and strategy, but in general, traders buy and sell in U.S. equity, options, and futures markets on both a manual and automated basis. Compensation in this role is based fully on an individual trader's performance.

The JV provides unique opportunities to talented, energetic people, rooted in the philosophy that everyone can do more than they realize if they try. The JV empowers independent thinkers who have the discipline to set long-term goals, the adaptability to “shift gears” but still stay on course, and who are open to being both a student and teacher in a learning organization.


In short, the Remote Trader role is a chance to join a high-performance team of:


•

experienced traders pushing their skills and adapting to new market opportunities;


•

talented technology professionals developing leading-edge trading and market analytics systems;


•

quantitative/business analysts providing tools and insights to fuel business growth;


•

top-notch support staff who keep everything humming and meet all challenges in a cool, casual atmosphere.


Our JV is currently seeking candidates who are excited about the prospect of pushing their own professional limits. Think you can do more?

About us
Our mission is eliminating the silence from sports.
We Build Trust into the Team Culture with Integrity.
There is an inherent imbalance of power between a coach and an athlete (doesn’t mean abusive)
that can often lead to an athlete’s inability to speak up. With silence　there is no integrity.
We work with teams to eliminate the silence out of sport to build and sustain integrity for all stakeholders.
The importance of addressing this it’s where injuries are born, either physical, mental or emotional.

We give everyone—from emerging artists to global brands—everything they need to design and deliver exceptional digital experiences! We’re passionate about empowering people to create beautiful and powerful images, videos, and apps, and transform how companies interact with customers across every screen.




We’re on a mission to hire the very best and are committed to creating exceptional employee experiences where everyone is respected and has access to equal opportunity. We realize that new ideas can come from everywhere in the organization, and we know the next big idea could be yours!




The Opportunity

Digital marketing is advancing at a dizzying pace and companies are turning to the Adobe Experience Cloud, the leader in enterprise marketing software, to stay ahead. Business Architects help customers achieve exceptional outcomes by advising them on the right digital experience strategies and consulting services needed to meet their business objectives. We help buying influencers rationalize investment in services with compelling, data supported materials and dialogue.

What you'll Do

Business Architects take part in multiple architecture engagements each quarter. For each engagement, we help conduct customer research & discovery, understand customer needs, define the scope and scale of business consulting services, contribute to the creation of presentations and other customer-facing artifacts, and present a proposal to the customer. To meet customer expectations, Business Architects must maintain a keen awareness of the Adobe product strategy, consulting offerings, and sales methodology. We collaborate with services sellers, solution architects, and other specialists to develop your recommendations.

This role offers rich opportunities to develop as a customer leader, problem solver, and digital experience professional. There will be frequent opportunities to interact with and influence senior decision makers. Hires will learn the Cloud business and develop their network as they collaborate with people across Adobe, including from Sales, Digital Strategy, and Professional Services. Our work will span across industries and help build out Adobe’s perspective on digital transformation. We will also help scale the Business & Solution Architecture group by improving our methodologies, mentoring others on the team, and eventually leading engagements and business initiatives.

Outstanding record of academic achievement or track record of demonstrating digital marketing prowess

Adaptability to navigate constantly evolving, frequently ambiguous scenarios with confidence and composure

Exceptional problem solving and analytical skills, including ability to create new knowledge, architecture, and frameworks

Ability to efficiently communicate sophisticated ideas verbally, visually and in writing

Ability to work collaboratively in a team environment—often remotely

Passion for new knowledge and ability to absorb concepts quickly

Our service does this through the collaborative work between our personalization teams and our Creative Production experts. We also know that we have work to do to ensure that our editorial work continues to be inclusive – that our consumer-facing metadata, title descriptions, localized text, and other editorially creative work consistently reflects our value of inclusion so that our Netflix consumers can see themselves reflected in the stories we carry and produce. This is coupled with our dedication to consistency in our internal-facing work so that we are contributing to interrupting marginalization and invisibilization in everything we touch.

Job Description

Imagine yourself as part of Visa’s HR & Learning Systems Strategy, Transformation and Innovation organization, a team that is responsible for driving the transformation towards world class workforce and partner experiences across the HR & Learning technology landscape. Workforce experience is a differentiator that enable Visa’s leaders to continue positioning the company for growth in the years to come. This affords you with a unique opportunity to work on some of the most highly visible initiatives inside one of the world’s most valuable brands. The role will allow you to be creative, strategic and impactful. It will also test your ability to thrive under the pressure of intense expectations and a multitude of critical stakeholders, and ultimately be a rock star in a company where industry leadership is the norm. You will have the unique opportunity to lead the systems strategy roadmap for our external platform capabilities by engaging key customers and being part of a growing business that will scale.

The HR & Learning Systems (Strategy, Transformation, Innovation) organization is part of Human Resources, which under the leadership of our Vice President constitutes an integral part of Visa’s Human Resources organization and reports to the Senior Vice President of HR Operations.



We are a key driver of change through purposeful technology. We are an established, successful global organization. We are a team of experts in our respective disciplines, but more importantly, we strive to harness our collective expertise in the most effective way for the benefit of employees. We combine rigor, data and subject matter expertise with intuition and common sense of what will be most effective for the business. We like to prototype, launch and evaluate. We are comfortable learning from our mistakes.

ABOUT YOU

You drive the strategy around the design of the platforms in harmony to produce an excellent workforce and partner experience. Purposeful integration and simplicity in creating delightful HR & Learning experiences are a hallmark of your record of accomplishment.

You use years of experience in design thinking, HR & learning technologies, product management, data analytics and people leadership to drive change that propels an organization forward. You believe intrapreneurship is a thing and can easily move between riffing on a new approach to engage fintechs on developing scalable delivery models that attract and deliver on Visa-verified solutions.

You have extensive prior experience managing and supporting multiple HR technology products and orchestrating their cohesion (includes but is not limited to HRIS, LXP, LMS, Talent Management, Talent Acquisition, Recruitment, Benefits, content providers and custom platforms). This could be in support of internal employee needs or external business partner and customer training.

You are driven by curiosity about new technologies and tools to enable workforce and partner experiences. Following, collaborating and synthesizing the innovation landscape is part of your DNA.

You are a collaboration expert and successfully can woo a crowd of matrixed stakeholders. You feel deep satisfaction from consensus-building and strive to educate and empower diverse thought partners in your everyday interactions

You love exploring and prototyping new workforce experiences. This could be through partnerships with suppliers to spearheading a HR & Learning hackathon that produces new prototypes for addressing workforce needs.

You have exceptional presentation and communication skills and thrive at delivering clear and concise messages that resonate with all audiences.

Your way of doing people research is by talking to them (often) and capturing the essence of those connection points

You do not need all the answers. You are resourceful, relentless, and resilient, and leverage your skills in asking the right questions to drive disparate resources towards the right answers. You will be working in a startup-like environment within a matrixed organization, this type of work should energize you

You live for figuring out how a new platform works – often stress testing its features and advocating for potential new features you think would add additional value. Leveraging your detail orientation enables you to oversee plans to shape the delivery of a work product and drive large project teams across the finish line

Key Responsibilities:

1. 
Think Big and Dive Deep - Lead small, medium and large-scale implementations including (but not limited to): Key investments in HR & Learning’s multi-year systems roadmap, modernizing our global workforce experience through technology and driving innovation through your innate ability to sense what is meaningful and simple to our workforce:
Set a vision for and use your influencing skills to lead HR technology strategy teammates towards a well-orchestrated and supported program plan that ensures effective launch and implementation

Translate program design into an innovative, technologically forward thinking and operational efficient solution that balances things like quality of workforce experience and operational cost of delivering

Be accountable for the transformational work occurring within the various cross-functional agile teams delivering on work by driving requirements and scope

Act as a strategic business partner to leadership by transforming strategic goals and priorities into a roadmap of business solutions, and then implementing digital solutions coupled with modern and efficient business processes
Operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath you that might live in other HR functions, system development/IT, HR Operations and production support

2. 
Invent and Simplify - Innovate and Grow the HR & Learning Product Portfolio: 
You will have an opportunity to evolve the existing product portfolio and launch new ones. You will leverage your strategic and critical thinking to articulate how the portfolio of solutions you own can evolve into the future. By leveraging your own knowledge of HR & Learning solutions and your vast network, you are able to articulate progressively evolving roadmaps that ensure an integrated workforce experience. Sometimes innovation means completely new ways of thinking and sometimes it means simply delightful tweaks to existing solutions. You operate on either ends of that spectrum and find joy in doing it.
Elicit and document requirements, perform impact analysis and create process improvement recommendations for complex technology projects that touch multiple domains in HR & Learning
Collaborate with IT and vendors to plan, implement, and build the right features / enhancements with a focus on solutions that solve for enterprise, end-to-end HR & Learning processes
Hunt for big ideas that identify and solve important HR problems and move beyond incremental features and instead propose a complete end-to-end automated solution

3. 
Earn Trust - Act as strategic business partner to HR leadership: 
You will skillfully cultivate and grow key internal and external relationships. You will form and engage in productive partnerships with critical internal HR and IT stakeholders – to evangelize the work we do, ensure a common understanding of the experience and scale it effectively across the organization. You will be versatile in the work you do in the context of these internal and external relationships: from ensuring buy-in with a senior internal stakeholder, to negotiating a contract with an outside provider and everything in-between.

4. 
Customer Obsession 
– 
Start with the customer and work backwards: 
You will work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust while having a bias for action. Speed matters and many decisions are reversible and do not need extension study. We value calculated risk taking.
Lead and drive UAT for large technology program delivery
Propose improvements for internal processes with an eye towards automating the manual (reduce all debt)
Provide project management support and communications for complex projects as well as anticipate and raise risks and propose mitigation plans
Use a combination of product instinct, data, and teamwork to ensure we provide well-crafted solutions
