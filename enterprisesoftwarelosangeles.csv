Our Story

Western Psychological Services (WPS) was established in 1948 in a little pink house in Brentwood, not far from the local VA hospital. Dr. Morse Manson, the company founder, developed a psychological test that would help returning World War II vets adjust to civilian life. This was the first of many psychological and educational assessments that WPS would publish over subsequent decades. Today these assessments are used by helping professionals throughout the world to evaluate, diagnose, and treat people in need—especially children and teens who have developmental, social, or behavioral challenges. WPS is known world-wide for our industry-leading autism assessments.

That’s the first part of the story: WPS is a stable, successful, family-owned company, 80+ employees strong, engaged in work that you can feel good about doing. This is a place where you can build a career—Many of our employees stick around for 10, 20, or even 30+ years.

Our Latest Chapter

The second part of our story starts with Jeff Manson, grandson of the founder (and now president of WPS), who’s making a big investment in the company’s future. He’s nurturing a transformative company culture that encourages innovation, creativity, transparency, and collaboration. And, as part of his commitment to a more open work environment, he moved the company a new home in Torrance, with plenty of elbow room, state-of-the-art equipment, and lots of amenities. The idea is that employees who are happy, empowered, acknowledged, and listened to will better serve the customer and the bottom line. It seems to be working—WPS continues to do well year after year!

Supplyframe is revolutionizing the electronics design and manufacturing industry with our software platforms, tools, and communities. Our engineering-first mindset and our positive and fast-paced environment make Supplyframe a great place to learn, work, and grow. Engineers who find themselves coming up with several solutions to a problem and analyzing the trade-offs of each will enjoy the opportunities and culture here.


This role is primarily focused on our Java Enterprise web application. Our software is used by many of the largest electronics manufacturing companies in the world. Building a tool that is flexible enough to accommodate a wide range of customer processes while remaining extremely stable and performant is a great engineering challenge.


In this role, you’ll work on a large variety of full-stack software engineering projects ranging from database and SQL design to developing web pages with frontend JavaScript frameworks. At Supplyframe, engineers take ownership of the code they write. The initial release of a new feature is not the end of the process; it is just the first step. You’ll have the opportunity to collect metrics and analyze patterns in production then iterate and improve your code.


Working with our small team in Austin, Texas will allow you to make a major impact on the software while learning about the whole spectrum of the software development life-cycle. We work closely with our QA and Support teams to ensure our customer’s experience is constantly improving.


Responsibilities


Cultivate a self-directed and determined approach to writing features and fixes in Java and JavaScript

Collaborate with QA and Support teams to refine requirements and iterate on testing feedback

Take ownership of your code during all phases of software development

Challenge yourself to go beyond the base requirement – edge cases, performance, error handling, etc.


Requirements


Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, similar technical field or equivalent practical experience

Software development experience in one or more general purpose programming languages (Java and JavaScript preferred)

Passion for writing robust and performant software

Experience with SQL and Spring Framework is a plus


Benefits


Competitive salary and bonus program in an entrepreneurial environment

Top-notch health, dental and vision insurance

401k plan with matching contribution

Generous paid time off plus paid holidays

Frequent catered lunches, happy hours, fun events, and plenty of snacks and drinks

Casual work environment


Supplyframe is an Equal Opportunity Employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, protected Veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law.

As everything has evolved around it, the technology available to support the way businesses engage with customers has mostly stood still. The tools we have on the phones in our pockets are wildly superior to what's available to us when we engage with our favorite brands. The truth that no one wants to say out loud is that Big Tech has held the customer experience hostage for decades with its giant servers, complex implementations, buried software and expensive contracts. And that's just not ok with us.



So we founded Edify and built Huddle to seize the opportunity in the void. With customer experience being the final frontier in winning the hearts and dollars of consumers long-term, the brands who prevail are going to be the ones who have tools to do what no one else can. At last, there's a more predictable, reliable, cost-effective, transparent, full-featured, cloud-native, easy-to-get-and-use, intuitive, accessible, genius single piece of software that's changing everything.The time for employees to love work, and customers to love companies is here. And finally, so are the tools.



We are Edify. And we're customers, too.

Are you looking to be a vital member of a disruptive company in the contact space? Do you thrive in the fast-paced, ever-changing environment of a start-up? The Enterprise Solutions Engineer is critical to the success of the sales organization, and we are looking for people that want to be an integral part of the team from initial conversation to customer conversion. The Edify Solutions Engineer is both highly technical and a skilled relationship builder. They are comfortable showing sketching out an API flow on a whiteboard with customer software engineers and engaging communications experience to a CEO.




At Edify, we believe the contact center industry is broken, and we are looking for people to help fix it.




We are looking for this Solutions Engineer to be located in the Western or Central US.

Our product is the world's first enterprise optimization system (EOS), a machine learning application that integrates with legacy enterprise resource planners (ERP) like SAP, Oracle, Microsoft Dynamics, or Epicor, and provides the user with the flows and recommendations on how to better buy, manage, price, and sell their inventory. Our customers are wholesalers and distributors, ranging from family-owned companies to the Fortune 500.

Despite being a multi-trillion dollar industry, wholesale distribution has a striking lack of software to support even basic operations, with most ERPs relying on decades-old architecture. Founded in Los Angeles and supporting a fully-remote team across the US, we are a well-funded Series A-stage startup, backed by some of the some of the most successful VCs in the world.

We're going after the archaic industry of enterprise resource planning, and a rosk-star sales team is critical to that transformation. The Enterprise Sales Executive’s primary responsibilities include prospecting, qualifying, selling, and closing new cloud and on-premise business to net-new customers. This position will be focused on accounts in the Continental US across multiple verticals.



As one of the founding members of our sales team, you will be responsible for setting the stage for future hires. In addition to driving new sales, you will have the opportunity to help refine the sales process and build a powerhouse sales team. A successful candidate will not only be expected to assist in producing content, collateral, and other supporting material, but also work closely with our founder as well as product and marketing leads on communicating our value proposition to prospective customers. To be a successful AE, you should have excellent communication, interpersonal, and customer service skills. You should also demonstrate the ability to meet deadlines and have strong analytical and mathematical skills.

What you will own

Demonstrate the business value proposition of Recurrency and our platform’s ability to augment the client’s current ERP solutions

Identify customer business pains and challenges and articulate those challenges into Recurrency solutions

Identify areas of innovation within the client base, and then coordinate cross-functionally to prove out the innovation and its business value for the customer

Develop new business sales opportunities in new accounts

Manage a number of complex sales opportunities simultaneously

Win complex sales deals in a competitive environment to achieve sales targets

Maintain broad and deep knowledge of current ERP portfolios, as well as industry trends

Build and maintain a deep understanding of our products and services to ensure the platform is cohesive and pushes the brand forward

Creatively push an industry reliant on - but drowning in - spreadsheets into a digital revolution

What you will bring

5+ years experience with SaaS sales, and 3+ of executing on a channel sales network with ERP vendors such as SAP, Oracle, Microsoft, Epicor, Sage, QAD or IFS

Evidence of over achievement within sales

An ability and drive to work in a fully-remote team environment

Evidence of entrepreneurial ability

Ability to forecast & manage a sales pipeline, and successfully close new business

Proven problem resolution, communication, planning & organizing, execution skills

Promotes a strong sense of urgency for reaching goals and key deliverables

Acts without being told what to do. Brings new ideas to the company

Capacity to understand Wholesaler pain points, requirements and correlating potential business to value

Strong verbal communication, presentation, and project management skills

Experience in the manufacturing industry would be an advantage

Excitement to join a small and mighty team and to build a strong culture and GSD

Joie de vivre

These would be great to have, but we’re sure this will become part of you

Experience and passion for Enterprise Distribution and ERPs

Good understanding of Software/Systems/Database architecture

Strong coaching and mentorship skills

A burning desire to bring change and disruption to ERPs

Virgin Galactic, www.VirginGalactic.com (NYSE: SPCE), recognizes that the answers to many of the challenges we face in sustaining life on our beautiful but fragile planet, lie in making better use of space. Sending people to space has not only expanded our understanding of science, but taught us amazing things about human ingenuity, physiology and psychology. From space, we are able to look with a new perspective both outward and back. From space, the borders that are fought over on Earth are arbitrary lines. From space, it is clear that there is much more that unites us than divides us.

“We are at the vanguard of a new industry determined to pioneer twenty-first century spacecraft, which will open space to everybody — and change the world for good.” Sir Richard Branson, Founder, Virgin Galactic

Accenture is a global professional services company with leading capabilities in digital, cloud and security. Combining unmatched experience and specialized skills across more than 40 industries, we offer Strategy and Consulting, Interactive, Technology and Operations services—all powered by the world’s largest network of Advanced Technology and Intelligent Operations centers. Our 506,000 people deliver on the promise of technology and human ingenuity every day, serving clients in more than 120 countries. We embrace the power of change to create value and shared success for our clients, people, shareholders, partners and communities. Visit us at www.accenture.com.

Most software developers, engineers, and architects get to build software systems. Very few get to say with a straight face: “I’m reinventing banking.” Or hospitality, or logistics, or insurance. We’re combining technology, industry expertise, and entrepreneurial experience to massively disrupt our clients’ core businesses. We partner with our clients to propel them into the future and to help create better products and experiences for everyone.

We’re doing this by leveraging the power of new patterns and architectures (Serverless, Microservices, Event Sourcing, etc) and technologies (Kafka, Elixir, TensorFlow, Node.js, Docker, Go) to build cloud-native style solutions for the enterprise. Most of our work fits what we call Digital Decoupling, where we design and build a state-of-the art system to wrap legacy, isolate legacy components, build new functionality, and slowly and methodically hollow out the existing core.

Our team is deeply hands-on, highly technical, and prides itself in being battle hardened, lead-from-the-front technology thought leaders. If you want to largely draw diagrams and pontificate on adding yet another layer to an already bloated monolith, this probably isn’t the role for you. Our competitors are hiring for that kind of thing.

If, however, you’re interested in solving some of the hardest problems in enterprise technology and transforming and disrupting established industries, let’s talk.

KEYWORDS – all levels

Docker, Kafka, TensorFlow, Node.js, Docker, Go, TypeScript, Hackathon, Rust, C++, Unity, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP). JavaScript, Microservices, DevOps, Blockchain, Event Sourcing, Streams, Mesosphere, Kubernetes




Here is what you need:


4+ years of hands-on experience building interesting and innovative applications, or equivalent open source contribution (several projects as ongoing contributor).
While we are looking for a mix of technologies, .NET or JEE application experience or legacy application maintenance probably don’t qualify as interesting or innovative.
Experience explaining complex technical concepts to an executive audience. If you can explain what event sourcing or the reactor pattern are to a layperson, you’ve got this.
Some experience designing and building software systems. i.e planning out infrastructure, cloud platform components, network details etc.
Experience working in an agile team.
Strong Critical Thinking, Analytical and Problem-Solving Skills
Excellent Communication and Interpersonal Skills. You will be expected to communicate business value for all technical solutions all the way to the C-Suite in some cases.
Curiosity and a desire to continuously learn
Initiative-taking is required. You will likely be given an objective, some constraints, and enough detail to get started. After that, we will expect you to solve problems without hand holding.
Working knowledge of git
Experience with at least one modern programming language (including but not limited to Go, Scala, Clojure, JavaScript, Elixir, Ruby, Python, Rust, and sometimes Java)
Bachelor's degree or equivalent (minimum 12 years) work experience. (If Associate’s Degree, must have minimum 6 years work experience)

Bonus Points if you have:



If you don’t have more than one or two, don’t be discouraged. We are a team with a very diverse set of skills and backgrounds, and a big part of that means different skills.




Experience with more than one programming language (JavaScript, Scala, Go, Elixir, Erlang, Python, or Rust preferred)
Hands on experience with Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, or Azure; namely choosing platform components and assembling application and runtime architecture
Experience with the Serverless framework and serverless architecture.
Experience with microservices architectures and constituent technologies (hapijs, gokit, Spring Cloud)
Experience with containerization and container platforms. (e.g. Docker, Kubernetes, Docker EE, Mesosphere)’
Experience with Event Driven Architectures and constituent technologies (e.g. Kafka, Kinesis) and patterns (Event Sourcing, etc)
Functional programming experience, specifically with Actor systems (Erlang, Elixir, Akka)
Experience with embedded devices and development (mostly C, but also some Rust, etc)
Experience with high performance networking (Quic, network layer optimization) or realtime transaction protocols/methods (HTTP2, Server Sent Events, MQTT, WebSockets)
Experience with distributed transactional data stores (CockroachDB, Spanner, ScyllaDB, etc)
Bachelor's degree (Computer Science, Engineering, Physics, Math preferred, not required).
