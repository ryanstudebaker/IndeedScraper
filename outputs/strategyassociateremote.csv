At Yelp, we believe that diversity is an expression of all the unique characteristics that make us human: race, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, disability, and education — and those are just a few. We recognize that diverse backgrounds and perspectives strengthen our teams and our product. The foundation of our diversity efforts are closely tied to our core values, which include “Playing Well With Others” and “Authenticity.”

We’re proud to be an equal opportunity employer and consider qualified applicants without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, age, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital or family status, veteran status, medical condition or disability.

We will consider for employment qualified candidates with arrest and conviction records, consistent with applicable law (including, for example, the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance for roles based in San Francisco).

Application Deadline: August 9th, 2021

Program Overview

Transportation is the single largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in the United States and the source of 24% of global emissions. To achieve emissions reductions in line with Paris Climate Accord goals, transformative change is required in the mobility sector over the next 10 years. To do this, we focus on vehicle electrification, charging infrastructure, and more energy efficient modes of transportation. We work with government, utilities, regulators, vehicle fleet operators, manufacturers, infrastructure providers, and others to improve the economics, availability, and desirability of clean mobility. We seek out innovative early adopters who are willing to experiment with and ultimately implement transformative solutions.


Position Overview:

As an Associate, you are a creative problem solver who uses your quantitative, technical and analytical abilities to conduct compelling research and stakeholder engagement around transportation electrification strategies and approaches. You will collaborate with team members to craft visionary yet practical solutions for our research questions and clients.

Synthesize ideas into clear and compelling presentations and written reports.

Analyze and present quantitative information in a clear, visual format.

Engage and build relationships with external information sources via phone interviews, conferences, and workshops.

Ability to think big and small: to understand and link market development and social change context with the specific day-to-day realities of mobility and RMI’s project portfolio

Interest in sustainability and energy with a proven ability to learn fast and create new insights

Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in an applicable field such as economics, science, engineering or business, at least one degree with significant analysis and data management components

While our environment is collaborative and relaxed, we build digital products that are well-considered and well-architected.



We’re excited to be adding a senior Strategist with a technical background to our Digital Strategy Team. We are looking for someone who is ready to make an impact, who has endless initiative and will invest the time and effort required to succeed. As an Associate Director, you’ll play a critical role in all stages of a project, so you must be a self-motivated and effective problem-solver who can prioritize and manage a challenging workload with multiple teams and clients. Being an Associate Director at Postlight means having the best of both worlds—you get to work on complex projects for high-profile clients while, at the same time, reap the benefits of working on a small team.



Who you are:




You are an experienced engineer or technical product manager interested in exploring a new side of your craft


You enjoy defining architecture to support products and platforms


You can translate complex technical concepts into stories for any audience


You are a good listener with strong deductive reasoning, who can make clear recommendations about what the next steps are


You have experience coaching multidisciplinary project teams through thick and thin


You’re comfortable presenting to senior executives, thinking on your feet, and defending your recommendations


You have the ability to read a room and react to the audience and needs on the fly


You have the ability to create decks and other storytelling artifacts for clients (both content and layout)


You’re equally comfortable reading analytics, API documentation, Jira tickets, and user research


You enjoy a challenge and are looking to grow


What you’ll be doing:


Early stage technical discovery and definition, from scoping and approach to staff planning


Helping our teams mitigate risk during the new business process


Partnering with clients to understand business models, objectives, and user behaviors and synthesize those insights to develop product visions and long-term product roadmaps


Collaborating with product managers, designers, and engineers to conceptualize, design, and deliver multi-platform applications


Communicating technical strategies and architecture to clients


Acting as a leader who can help guide teams, clients, and projects to success without compromising strategy by educating and convincing internal and external stakeholders through analytical thinking and breadth of experience


Serving as an internal expert on technical subjects for our internal and external clients


Constantly searching and learning to stay one step ahead of our clients and competitors


Requirements:


BS degree in STEM or equivalent industry experience as an engineer or technical product manager


5 years of experience influencing product strategy and roadmaps as part of multi-disciplinary teams


Demonstrated experience defining and designing platform architectures


Experience building and shipping user-facing apps, web applications and platforms


Demonstrated ability to develop strong relationships and build trust with colleagues and empowered decision-makers


Comfort and desire to work with quick deadlines and ambiguity, as well as share in-progress work at all levels of fidelity


Ability to rapidly build expertise on new businesses and industries


Strong proficiency with Keynote/Google Workspace/Sheets/Slack


Strong opinions, weakly held


Your skillset will grow at Postlight. You will join a team excited about the problems they solve and the tools they use to solve them. We keep pace with the industry, and are active participants in the open-source world. You will find yourself regularly growing in your career, using new tools and frameworks to solve new kinds of problems—with support from management and mentors.


Whether working on site or remotely, your communication skills will be as important as your technical ones. Collaborating across time zones requires constant, clear communication and coordination, via Slack, documents, and frequent video conferences.

You’ll be working with a world-renowned tech client leading the way in innovation. If you’re looking to closely collaborate with your clients, immerse yourself in challenging, incredibly rewarding work, and build a high performing team to help you do it, this could be the job for you.



If topics like digital product development, trust in tech, data privacy, the news landscape - and an occasional tech controversy or two - pique your interest, definitely read on.



Who You Are



You are a proven leader who believes in making business more human. You believe that companies should innovate from the outside-in; that the customer perspective should guide companies, not the other way around. You love diving into client challenges and “navigating in the grey”. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, you’re a team player – you know that you’re only as good as the team you lead and you love bringing out the best in those around you.



What You’ll Do



 Client Leadership




Know your clients.
 Understand the goals of your clients’ organizations and recognize your clients’ individual roles in achieving those goals.


Build strong relationships
. In partnership with your teams, create trusted relationships with senior level clients that drive great work and account growth.


Uncover the opportunity. 
Create space to listen, plan, and workshop with your clients at the start of the engagement and check-in throughout.


Bring the brief
. Leveraging our thought leadership and integrated services, grow the business by regularly uncovering opportunities to deliver value across your clients’ organizations.


Manage the account. 
Ensure we are delivering what our clients’ expect and communicate with finance on revenue implications as they arise. Provide input on forecast, salesforce updates, scope tracking etc.


Inspire your clients (to be better). 
Actively connect the dots, from consumer and industry trends to the competitive landscape, bring a holistic perspective to our clients’ business on a regular basis. Make them better at their jobs for knowing you.




 Develop High-Performance Teams




Lead by example. 
Demonstrate and coach your teams in client empathy, client stewardship and commercial skills.


Build accountability. 
Define clear roles internally to leverage superpowers and development opportunities, leading to a great employee (and client) experience.


Deliver feedback. 
Help your teammates grow by delivering timely and direct feedback, positive and constructive, even when it’s tough.


Develop talent. 
Work with managers, HR and L&D colleagues to identify opportunities for new skill development, performance excellence and career growth.


Inspire your teams (to be better). 
Lead with creativity, imagination and passion. Be the type of leader who energizes their team on a regular basis.




Desired Skills & Experience




7-8+ years of relevant experience in Consulting, Innovation, Marketing/Brand Strategy, Customer Experience, Account Planning, or Consumer Insights. Strong agency experience preferred.


Deep knowledge of the Technology space.


Exceptional organizational skills and ability to deal with competing priorities.


Demonstrated ability to drive account growth through solving big, meaty client challenges.


Strong collaboration across internal teams to drive impact for clients.


Ability to multi-task, work independently and as part of a multidisciplinary team, exercise sound judgment, and escalate issues when necessary.




We are focused on building a diverse and inclusive business and we welcome applications from people from diverse backgrounds, abilities, and walks of life – talented, creative people with their own voice, ideas and perspectives. So if you think you have the right skills and mindset for this position, whether through education, work or life experience, please apply.

About March On and Future Coalition 
Founded in 2017, March On is a 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization focused on harnessing the grassroots energy of mass mobilizations to create political power. March On supports and provides resources to hundreds of local affiliates and organizers nationwide, mobilizes our network for national campaigns, and partners with progressive organizations on joint initiatives. Since our inception, we have fundamentally shifted the balance of power by marching people to the polls through our monumental March On The Polls Midterm 2018 efforts, by amassing millions of people in the streets during the Women’s Marches of 2017, 2018, and 2019, and, through our Vote With Us campaign during the 2020 elections.
Built by youth activists, for youth activists, Future Coalition is a national network that fosters community and collaboration among youth leaders and youth-led organizations. Young people have the ideas and passion to make incredible change in their local communities, in the country, and in the world. Future Coalition provides these young people with the tools, resources, and support to power their ideas and amplify their impact. For the last two years Future Coalition has coordinated the US Climate Strike Coalition, the coalition of over 500 organizations that collaborate to organize the Climate Strikes in the US. We were behind the September 20, 2019 Climate Strikes that mobilized over 650,000 people in the US. For the 2020 general election and the Georgia special elections, we helped to rally the largest voter turnout in the history of our country.
March On began incubating Future Coalition in June of 2018. After supporting 50 Miles More, one of its original member organizations, March On was uniquely positioned to offer the infrastructure and guidance needed to develop Future Coalition. Over the last few years, MO and FC have found many ways to collaborate through campaigns and programming. While the two organizations are autonomous and have their own individual identities, when it comes to strategy and operations, we share much of the work around administration, communications, digital, fundraising, fiscal projects, and more. We refer to our organizational structure as a “special unicorn” because we have built ourselves to be intergenerational, collaborative, and intersectional in everything we do.
March On and Future Coalition share core beliefs around the power of collaboration and community––centering local, grassroots organizers to effect change. This relationship is at the heart of our family of organizations.
MO/FC is a 501c4 organization, fiscally sponsored by March On Foundation, a 501c3. Incorporated in DC, and based in Colorado administratively, we work 100% remotely (this is especially true as we continue to battle the pandemic.) Our leadership is composed entirely of women and non-binary folx and more than half of our team are women of color. We’re proudly feminist and we embrace creativity and openness. We work hard, and expect the ideal candidate to be as passionate and dedicated as we are about making, building and sustaining grassroots power for progressive change. We’re looking for someone who is excited to be a key part of the operational infrastructure of the organization.
COMPENSATION 
MO/FC offer competitive compensation, commensurate with experience and in line with industry standards.
Expected salary range: $50,000-$60,000. Full-time, non-exempt position.
Our compensation package for full-time employees includes a monthly healthcare subsidy, and access to healthcare plans through United HealthCare.
We are an Equal Opportunity Employer and do not discriminate in hiring or employment on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, gender identity and expression, marital status, sexual orientation, age, disability, veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by federal, state, or local law. Women, people of color, members of the LGBTQ community, and members of other historically disenfranchised groups are especially welcome and encouraged to apply.
