It's where the people you need, the information you share, and the tools you use come together to get things done. Apps allow teams to bring more of their work into Slack that automate routine tasks and integrate with other tools. Slack is looking for a product manager to focus on making it even easier to build Slack apps through new offerings to developers and Slack customers.



Slack has a positive, diverse, and supportive culture—we look for people who are curious, creative, and work to be a little better every single day. In our work together we aim to be smart, humble, hardworking and, above all, collaborative. If this sounds like a good fit for you, why not say hello?



What you will be doing


Owning a product strategy and feature roadmap to deliver on the needs of people who build Slack apps across a range of technical levels and capabilities.


Building an understanding of Slack app developers, both inside and outside large organizations.


Creating new APIs to allow easier creation of new Slack app capabilities. Launching new services to support Slack developers and reduce friction for Slack development.


You will build fundamentals that enable and grow the ecosystem of apps that connect Slack to productivity applications, together with our partner-facing teams.


In tandem with engineering leadership, develop appropriate planning, prioritization, and release management processes to enable launch of new functionality for developers and Slack customers.


Drive execution against plan, anticipating risk, and leading discussion via frequent, clear communication, both internally and with partners.


Prioritize and design features for a variety of personas, from non-technical Slack users to Slack power-users to developers


Understanding Slack user, administrator, and developer dynamics to build healthy ecosystems


What you should have


Experience as a product manager working on technical products, especially APIs and developer platforms. Security interest or experience is optional but a plus.


A passion for Slack and the problems we are solving


Desire to understand Slack developers and users of varying skill levels and technical capabilities - their capabilities, needs, and how they work


Ability to manage complex internal and external stakeholders and find creative solutions


Track record of working with engineering and partner teams: people want to work with you again

About the job

The Google Cloud Platform team helps customers transform and evolve their business through the use of Google’s global network, web-scale data centers and software infrastructure. The Cloud Marketing team is looking for people who can help us write and tell the story of our customer's journey. Understanding the power of our products and how they impact businesses, you will help share how we provide our customers with the best solutions for innovation. If you’re as excited about building what’s next as we are, Google Cloud is the place for you.


As the Product Marketing Manager for Google Chat and Google Workspaces, you’ll work to drive the overall business forward across our consumer and commercial audience. You’ll work cross-functionally with many teams across Google to influence the development of these products and own the go-to-market strategy to lift brand awareness and grow product usage. This includes working with Google Workspace product management, marketing, global brand, PR, and partner teams to build your strategy and field marketing teams to help put your plan into action.

Know the user. Know the magic. Connect the two. At its core, marketing at Google starts with technology and ends with the user, bringing both together in unconventional ways. Our job is to demonstrate how Google's products solve the world's problems-from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can-changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.

Responsibilities


Partner with product and UX teams to shape the product strategy, vision, and positioning for Google Chat and Google Workspace


Develop actionable insights from user and industry research that inform marketing strategy and messaging


Lead cross-functional marketing across brand, media, and partnerships to develop a cohesive marketing strategy and plan


Collaborate with cross-product areas and field marketing teams to execute global go-to-market and growth campaigns to lift brand awareness and product usage

Millions of people across the world come to Pinterest to find new ideas every day. It's where they get inspiration, dream about new possibilities and plan for what matters most. Our mission is to help those people find their inspiration and create a life they love. In your role, you'll be challenged to take on work that upholds this mission and pushes Pinterest forward. You'll grow as a person and leader in your field, all the while helping Pinners make their lives better in the positive corner of the internet.

The ideas that we put in front of millions of Pinners come from Creators, and the Pinterest experience is only as inspiring as the quality of the ideas that come from them. Creators are motivated by the community built around their passions and some even aspire to make a living doing what they love. In this role, you’ll build products to grow the number of people who create content on Pinterest. You’ll work closely with engineering and design to define, measure, and drive day-to-day features centered around the creator journey, but with a close eye on maintaining the quality of the content for Pinners.

What you’ll do:

Lead product vision, strategy, development, and execution for the Creator Growth team; these are products centered around the Creator journey- identifying, onboarding, and activating them into the creation flows. Enhance creator understanding of why it’s valuable to create on Pinterest, as well as optimize creators emails and notifications program

Inspire your cross-functional partners: engineering, design, business analytics, marketing, research, and creator management teams to achieve business objectives

Execute ruthlessly- define and deliver product features aligned to your team’s goals

Clearly communicate roadmap, progress, and insights to adjacent product teams and stakeholders

What we’re looking for:

1+ year of product management or related experience at fast growing companies

Proven ability to lead teams and work with design and engineering to deliver great user experiences on time in a highly collaborative environment

Analytic abilities- experience with SQL and AB testing; demonstrated ability to use data to weave a narrative to inform strategic decisions

A thirst for knowledge and growth

Experience working with a creator audience a plus

You’re an experienced product manager, you want to be part of a company at the forefront of measuring public opinion, and you’re eager to improve the world by providing better data to leaders who will make the world more humane, scientific, and just.



Since 2017, we’ve been making it possible for forward thinking organizations and political candidates to quickly, affordably, and accurately measure public opinion online. Forward-thinking candidates, causes, cities, and companies use our data to understand people’s needs, improve messaging, and accomplish their goals.



Change Research’s work sits at the intersection of data, social science, governance, and politics. We strive to improve American democracy and people’s lives.



We value a diverse and inclusive workplace where we learn from each other. Our leadership team has a broad mix of professional backgrounds, from startups to political consulting, and from pure tech to Congressional staffing. We invite folks with different backgrounds, experiences, abilities, and perspectives. Black, Indigenous and people of color, LGBTQ+ people, women, veterans, and people living with disabilities are encouraged to apply. We are an equal opportunity employer. Join us.



About the role:



As our product manager, you will work closely with the engineering team — three engineers and one data scientist — that builds the software underlying our fast, affordable, accurate approach to polling. You will also speak with our clients to better understand how our product solves their challenges, and work closely with colleagues in sales and polling to understand their needs. You will play a key role in product and strategic decision making with other leaders at Change Research.



You are product-oriented, and you’re committed to taking on technical, product, and business challenges as we push the industry and the world to rethink what measuring public opinion means, and ramp up in the face of heavy demand for polling. You’re comfortable running meetings, getting feedback and ideas from multiple internal and external stakeholders, and collaborating across different teams within the company to get products built and out to the market.



Our engineering/product/data science team consists of people comfortable wearing multiple hats. We are full-stack developers (backend/frontend), “full-stack data” engineers (data pipelines and analytics and/or machine learning), data scientists, product people, and data analysts.



As our product manager, you will:




Understand and Collaborate


Spend time with both internal (survey data analysts, sales team members) and external (campaign managers, communications directors, city managers, managing directors) stakeholders to deeply understand the problems Change Research can help solve.


Work with the heads of our two business units — Change Research Politics and Advocacy and Embold Research — to prioritize feature development, and understand what can most benefit each.


Run standups and planning meetings.


Coordinate with other leaders across the company on priorities.


Define


Work with our pollsters, data scientists, and leadership team to build out our product roadmap.


Spec out internal tools that will make our pollsters more efficient.


Spec out, design, and maintain dashboards for internal data consumption, and dashboards and data visualizations that help our clients understand our findings.


Research and understand different dynamics and platforms for reaching potential survey respondents. You will develop a perspective on whether we should be hiring interns to go door to door to speak to voters (we’re pretty sure the answer on this one is “no”!)


Analyze


Own our internal dashboards in support of our metrics-driven culture.


Dig into internal operational data; use it as a key driver of prioritization.


Understand how our polling data is used by our clients to make strategic and tactical decisions




Through it all, you’ll listen, think, communicate and execute in a way that considers the company’s and customer’s process holistically. You are obsessed with results, quality, problem solving, and creativity. You are a team player who can lead and execute.



About you:




2+ years of product experience


Strong interest in politics and civic engagement; previous experience helpful but not required


Significant experience in analyzing data, whether as a product manager, an analyst, a pollster, or something else. SQL skills are a big plus.


Strong communication skills


Comfortable working with engineers


Comfortable with some ambiguity and a willingness to iron out the missing details


Enthusiastic and professional


Startup-minded: you plug holes, get things done, and think of ways to improve systems


Flexible with the ability to work with a variety of personalities and types of work


Excited to be part of a team committed to making a difference in our country’s political climate


Comfortable in a remote work environment




Compensation and work environment:



This position pays an annual salary of $85,000-120,000



We offer competitive salaries, plus company equity, a flexible paid time off program, health, dental, and vision insurance, and company holidays. Change Research is an equal opportunity employer with a team around the country.

Slack already has one of the largest paid customer bases in enterprise software, with hundreds of thousands of recurring paid teams. In this role, you’ll strive to 10x the Slack paid customer base and as a result shape the growth of the company and an entire industry by ensuring Slack is “where work gets done"", especially as the world continues to shift to remote.



This product manager will join the Monetization team, with the initial responsibility for making Slack's premium products dramatically easier and more compelling to purchase. You’ll lead our pricing and packaging efforts, to ensure that Slack is easy to buy for all types of users and teams. You will deliver a best-in-class experience with close collaboration with cross-functional technical, business, and external teams.



You should be a hands-on and technically savvy Product Manager who is constantly identifying user problems and thinking critically about which to prioritize. You know how to measure and interpret the results of your team’s efforts. You can effectively navigate complex systems and can communicate product requirements to both engineering and non technical teams. You love working on teams, side-by-side with the best engineers and designers. You easily manage several projects at once and you don’t miss deadlines.



Slack has a positive, diverse, and supportive culture—we look for people who are curious, inventive, and work to be a little better every single day. In our work together we aim to be smart, humble, hardworking and, above all, collaborative. If this sounds like a good fit for you, why not say hello?



What you will be doing


You will develop the product vision, strategy, and roadmap to develop a best in class purchase experience for Slack’s paid features in concert with cross-functional peers.


You’ll determine the company’s pricing and packaging strategy, and how we think about our freemium and paid tiers.


You’ll become an authority on your product area. You’ll identify customer needs and business opportunities through a combination of research, feedback collection from cross-functional teammates and competitive data analysis.


You’ll define, understand, and improve key funnels and metrics.


You’ll own features and experiments end-to-end, including writing product specs, driving cross-functional execution, making thoughtful product decisions along the way, and sharing insights and results throughout the company.


You’ll drive execution against our plan in collaboration with Engineering and Design peers: making trade-offs, anticipating staffing needs and risks, and ensuring frequent and clear communication.


You’ll partner closely with leaders across product, engineering, finance, and operations, as well as external partners and customers.


You’ll execute at a fast pace with a focus on delivering impact to customers


What you should have


Passion about Slack and the problem we’re solving.


At least 3+ years of experience leading major product or growth initiatives across user-facing products. You can take rough themes and turn them into a roadmap of features, experiments, and research with minimal guidance.


Impact focus and a consistent history of delivering measurable results for both users and the business.


Technical experience so that you can weigh tradeoffs and have in depth discussions with engineers on the nuances of complex engineering systems.


Data-minded whenever possible. You deeply understand how your products work and how to measure long-term impact. You can design, run, and interpret experiments and A/B tests, and probably know a bit of SQL.


Ability to think big and small to build a portfolio of experiments and larger features. You are as comfortable whiteboarding a completely new experience as you are optimizing an existing flow and know when to do which.


Impeccable follow-through. You say what you’ll do, and do what you say. You hold your team to this standard. You don’t let details slip.


Product taste and craft. You will own important product interactions with every Slack customer, and should show the attention to detail this responsibility deserves.


You listen well. You build consensus by default, but can drive hard decisions when needed. You push the pace. You take blame and pass on praise. People love working with you.


You’re comfortable discussing technical tradeoffs with engineers.


Written communication that is clear and effective.
