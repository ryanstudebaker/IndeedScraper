ABOUT OUR STORES:

Working at PetSmart is not a job, it’s a community of those who work together for the love of pets. As a 
PetSmart Sales Associate
, you aren’t just selling products, you’re helping pet parents find the very best 
solutions
 for their pets. With your passion for pets and our education, you’ll become a trusted partner to the families at every stage of their pets’ lives. With so many opportunities under one roof, you'll be sure to find a career path that inspires you.

ABOUT OUR TEAMS:

In a store as big as ours, we need all hands (or paws, wings, fins, whatever you have!) on deck to ensure we are operating efficiently. Our stores offer multiple shifts throughout the early morning, day, and evening hours. So, as a PetSmart sales associate, you may be cross-trained in the following areas:

Customer Service
: You’ll be an essential part of creating sincere connections with pet parents. You’ll welcome them (and their pets!) to the store, facilitate an easy check out process as a cashier and ensure that they found everything they needed.

Pet Care: 
You’ll ensure the safety of all living pets our stores—including fish, reptiles, birds, and small animals. You’ll be their family until they get a family of their own; you’ll help to keep them healthy, clean, and well fed! You’ll also engage with pet parents to provide them with the best solutions specifically for their pets.

Merchandising & Inventory: 
You’ll play an integral role in helping our pet parents find exactly what they need, right when they need it. You’ll execute on merchandising, stocking, and pricing strategies.

ABOUT YOUR CAREER:

And while we’re there for pets at every stage of their lives, we’ll be with you at every stage of your career. With PetSmart, you will have opportunities to:

Gain experience in a different business unit—from the store to the salon or the Pets Hotel

Develop your leadership skills as a Department or Assistant Manager role

Tackle the challenge of a new store opening

Transfer to any one of our 1600 stores nationwide

THE WARM AND FUZZIES:

We’ve highlighted job responsibilities as best as we could above—but the best parts of working at PetSmart can’t be fully described in the job description.

It’s the excitement you feel when you help a little one pick out his very first fish. And not just any goldfish, but that one, right there, no not that one, this one, yea!

It’s the relief Rosie feels when you help her mom select the best food for her upset tummy and her delight when it turns out to be chicken flavored!!

It’s the pride of the giving Mickey a makeover in our salons watching him strut his stuff on the way out. Paws off, ladies, he’s taken!

It’s the joy of reuniting Frankie with her family after a fun stay in our Pets Hotel.

It’s the celebration of Bella’s birthday, Gizmo’s graduation from puppy classes or Ace’s adoption.

It’s the little things we do that add up to really big things that pets need.


Working at PetSmart is not a job, it’s a community of those who work together for the love of pets.

*
Essie Justice Group (Essie) is building grassroots power to dismantle the US incarceration system, the most egregious creator of racial and gender injustice of our time.* We are a loving and powerful community of women with incarcerated loved ones and include cisgender women, transgender women, formerly incarcerated women, gender non-conforming (gnc) people, elders, and young people.
Building a sustainable grassroots institution that can be leveraged in the fight for a Black Feminist future is a priority at Essie. Through the development of thoughtful organizing models, a vibrant organizational culture, and scalable structure our aim is to break the isolation of the 1 in 4 women who have loved ones behind bars and sustain bold decarceration advocacy through the leadership of women with loved ones behind bars. After seven years building an active membership across California, Essie is waging ever more ambitious campaigns to divest from state-sponsored punitive control and invest in structures that support the self-determination, freedom, and dignity of Black women and gender non-conforming (gnc) people. 
Ready to scale our organizing program 
to build the first national community of women with incarcerated loved ones in the United States, 
we are seeking a motivated, strategic and mission-driven Associate Director of Programs to lead the team that brings this vision to life.
The Associate Director of Programs knows how to leverage people and resources to accomplish significant goals. As an integral member of the senior management team for Essie’s Membership & Organizing Team, the Associate Director will lead a team to run leadership development programs including Essie’s signature organizing mode - our Healing to Advocacy program, and our Campaign School. The Associate Director of Programs oversees all program implementation, supervision, coaching and development of staff to ensure our programs are thriving, innovative, and impactful.
Essie’s Healing to Advocacy organizing model and programs have graduated 29 cohorts of women and gnc people with incarcerated loved ones into our membership. Program graduates make up the core of our member leadership structure across California. We are excited to expand our membership of women with incarcerated loved ones across the country while sustaining the model as a key pillar in our movement-building strategy. The Associate Director of Programs will drive this initiative and manage the team who executes it.
The ideal candidate is a seasoned program director who thrives when designing and running programs and also has the organizing instincts to understand how to leverage programs to build people power and drive movement-building work at scale. This person is an innovator who can take a program from ideation to implementation to scale, and can coach and inspire their team to engage in continuous learning to improve the program over time and as it grows.

Who We’re Looking For
Ideal Qualifications
7+ years experience in adult learning and program management (design, implementation and/or evaluation) preferably in community organizing contexts with a leadership development focus and a minimum of 2 years serving in management role(s) within the nonprofit sector.
Meaningful experience supervising multiple full time staff and experience supporting colleagues with direct experience of incarceration.
Significant experience supervising people in a way that acknowledges differentials in privilege and power, recognizes their gifts, encourages their confidence, supports their growth, and holds them accountable to standards.
Advanced experience in facilitating retreats, workshops, and/or popular education trainings.
Impeccable attention to detail and effective writing, editing, and verbal communication skills.

Qualities
Big picture planner. 
You find great joy in running smooth and efficient programs and leading a high-functioning team. With ease and grounded purpose, you regularly look ahead and see how your near-term efforts collectively build up to create a powerful movement to end systems of oppression.
A sophisticated builder. 
You love helping people learn and grow, try new things, and think more deeply about their own potential for impact. In this way, you build the confidence of others and you build strong teams. But you are not satisfied with that alone, you care deeply about the tangibles of what those teams create. You are good at coming up with new models, programs, and structures and managing participatory creative processes. You employ numbers, SMART goals, and evaluative data because you connect to their pragmatic value, rather than an empty “best practice.”
Discernment and honesty we can trust. 
You are a thoughtful team member who acts in alignment with your integrity and are unfailingly trustworthy.
Sees #Woke as a verb.
 You are committed to continuously deepening and evolving your own understanding of systems of oppression through study, openness, and humility. And you easily recognize your own relationship to privilege and power, examining and shifting your behaviors as appropriate.
Uplifting and additive.
 You see mistakes as opportunities for growth; problems as catalysts for solutions, and inspire others along the journey. You carry a positive approach, can-do attitude, a sense of humor, and authentic kindness wherever you go.

Oaktree is seeking an associate to work within the Special Situations Group for a 2-year program. Our Special Situations strategy makes control-oriented debt and equity investments in middle-market companies that have an element of distress, dislocation or dysfunction and that we perceive to be undervalued. It seeks situations in which we can gain control of, or significant influence over, companies exhibiting such characteristics and then actively manages those businesses in an effort to deliver value as a private equity-like sponsor. The cornerstone of the Special Situations strategy is its flexibility to invest across capital structures, whether by purchasing secondary market debt (distress-for-control) or making direct equity investments in distressed businesses. Importantly, the strategy does not require a distressed macro environment to invest successfully, relying instead on “situational” distress that can be uncovered in any industry, sector or individual company at any point in the economic cycle.

The Associate will participate in all transaction functions and portfolio management activities including:

Preparing detailed financial modeling;

Performing quantitative and qualitative analysis;

Developing and maintaining business and industry due diligence;

Participating in deal structuring, legal documentation and negotiations; and

Monitoring the performance of existing portfolio investments.

*
Essie Justice Group (Essie) is building grassroots power to dismantle the US incarceration system, the most egregious creator of racial and gender injustice of our time.* We are a loving and powerful community of women with incarcerated loved ones and include cisgender women, transgender women, formerly incarcerated women, gender non-conforming (gnc) people, elders, and young people.
Building a sustainable grassroots institution that can be leveraged in the fight for a Black Feminist future is a priority at Essie. Through the development of thoughtful organizing models, a vibrant organizational culture, and scalable structure our aim is to break the isolation of the 1 in 4 women who have loved ones behind bars and sustain bold decarceration advocacy through the leadership of women with loved ones behind bars. For the past seven years, we have been building an active membership across California and at the national level, led in the development of the transformative policy solutions including the Movement for Black Lives's BREATHE Act last year. Now, Essie is waging ever more ambitious campaigns to divest from state-sponsored punitive control and invest in structures that support the self-determination, freedom, and dignity of Black women and gender non-conforming (gnc) people. 
We are seeking a sharp, highly strategic, and forward-thinking Associate Director of Campaigns to support our team in building and implementing campaigns to upend systems of control and confinement.
The Associate Director of Campaigns is a collaborative leader committed to leveraging and enhancing the power of our members and staff to achieve concrete and transformative change. This person will serve as a strategic thought-partner to Essie’s Director of Campaigns & Advocacy and play a key role in the Campaigns & Advocacy Department to meet its ambitious goals of ushering in an era of prison closure and Black feminist freedom. The Campaigns & Advocacy Department is charged with developing statewide and national advocacy campaigns that will best position us to win the demands published in our groundbreaking report, Because She’s Powerful: The Political Isolation and Resistance of Women with Incarcerated Loved Ones. The Associate Director of Campaigns will work closely with colleagues across the organization to ensure our campaigns are strategically aligned, properly resourced, and fueled by the participation and leadership of our Essie membership.
The ideal candidate for this role is a natural and enthusiastic systems-builder who is deeply familiar with the ebbs and flows of power-based campaigning work. The Associate Director of Campaigns can detect emerging needs in a campaign and respond in an innovative and timely manner. This person is a skilled project manager who can discern between urgent and important needs and appropriately triage multiple incoming requests. The Associate Director of Campaigns also has the emotional intelligence to stay attuned to team morale and can press pause in a fast-paced work environment to coach team members when they encounter challenges.

Typically after 9 to 12 months in our dedicated Associate Program, you will progress from a new hire to a seasoned connector and take the next step in your Third Bridge career.

The next step in your Third Bridge career could be:

Welcome to Peacock, the dynamic new streaming service from NBCUniversal. Here you’ll find more than a job. You’ll find a fast-paced, high-flying team for unique birds that want to be at the epicenter of technology, sports, news, tv, movies and more. Our flock works hard to connect people to what they love, each other and the world around them by creating shared experiences through culture-defining entertainment.



As a company, we embrace the power of difference. Our team is committed to creating an organization that champions diversity and inclusivity for all by curating content and a workforce that represents the world around us. We continue to challenge ourselves and the industry by being customer-centric, data-driven creatures of innovation.

Description



Peacock’s Virtual Channels team leads the programming, scheduling, operations and measurement of a fast-growing portfolio of 24/7 linear and on-demand video channels streaming an array of entertainment, news and sports content. In developing lean-back program schedules that span Saturday Night Live, Dateline and the WWE, the team plays a key role in establishing Peacock’s leadership in the FAST (free ad-supported streaming TV) channel space.

In addition, you will access numerous tools to gather performance data and derive insights that can be used to optimize channel lineups and drive consumption.



This is a hands-on role involving close collaboration with both creative and technical partners. We are seeking a highly motivated, intensely creative individual who can operate independently, is adept at swiftly handling change, has a “start-up” mentality, and is comfortable with troubleshooting challenges in constantly evolving technical systems.




We’re also looking for those who want to help build a new corporate culture. At Peacock we are passionate about movies, TV shows and building a new streaming service from scratch, but we think it’s really important to have fun while doing so.
