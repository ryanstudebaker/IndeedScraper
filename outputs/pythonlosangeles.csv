Looking for Compositors available to start in August, to be part of this ground breaking team.


Candidates must be Los Angeles based, US Citizens or legal to work in US.


Arguably one of the most talented Compositing teams in the world, we are currently comprised of 130 artists with a 2D pipeline that is second to none. Focusing predominately on deep compositing, our tools help us deliver extraordinary projects efficiently and effectively – not an easy feat when you’re at the end of the pipeline!


We have worked hard to grow our Compositing team, not just in size, but across all roles from Junior Compositor through to Comp Supervisor. We work closely with our sister departments Paint and Roto and company-wide to nurture budding talent, cross-training across several disciplines which ensures that our team are diverse both in personality and skillset.


You'll be responsible for the compositing of multiple image layers derived photographically and computer-generated into a single cohesive image. Ensuring photoreal integration of all VFX elements with the live action plate and establish aesthetic consistency across your shot, in line with feedback from the Compositing Supervisor/VFX Supervisor.


Our successful candidate will have:


Well-developed artistic sensibilities and be able to interpret notes.


A resilient and positive attitude and a proactive communication style.


Good knowledge of Nuke’s Gizmos and Groups workflows.


Basic Scripting ability (MEL, Python).


Demonstrable understanding of the principles of cinematography, photography and colour science and of course Compositing best practices.


3+ years as a Compositor in Feature Films




If this sounds like you - we would love to hear from you.


Weta Digital is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate our diversity and believe in creating an environment where all our crew feel welcomed, respected, supported and appreciated.

Hulu is a premium streaming service that offers premium originals, current season TV, a massive library of hit series and movies, and live television. Disney+ is the Disney-branded streaming service featuring an outstanding collection of content from its brands and franchises recognized and respected all over the world including Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar, Disney, and NatGeo. Our combined Disney and Hulu team is looking for hardworking team players to join the Media Engineering team, who will thrive upon the legacy of Disney and Hulu, embrace unconventional thinking, and who are passionate about contributing to The Walt Disney Company’s direct-to-consumer (DTC) experience through strategic hard work and determination.

The Live Pipeline (Video) team is responsible for ensuring that Hulu's customers have a reliable Live TV experience and are able to enjoy live events in high quality and with high availability. The team has ownership for the different renditions of video - everything from mobile to TV. They are responsible for the packaging of content, both DRM and protocol delivery formats – delivering video to an iOS device is much different than delivering video to an XBOX One. The team is responsible for end-to-end quality for video delivery. We deal with a wide variety of channels, each with their own quirks, and have to build systems to keep the streams flowing 24/7, despite these complexities. We are looking for a talented Software Developer to help us build the most sophisticated, reliable video delivery engine in the industry.

Data Science and Engineering

Netflix is revolutionizing the entertainment industry with world-class technology. We are both a content distributor and a producer for original and premium shows. We serve millions of subscribers worldwide in more than 190 countries around the world. We produce hundreds of new series, movies, documentaries, stand-up specials, and other categories of content each year. Because of our global footprint, we are able to elevate new types of creators, tell a diverse set of stories and inspire a global audience.

The Content Knowledge Graph team, within Data Science and Engineering, plays a central role at the company and supports critical decisions such as predicting the value of content and understanding how key elements contribute to a title’s success. Arming our demand prediction and creative teams by mapping the world’s content improves both the efficiency and accuracy of decision-making and helps Netflix produce more hits and member joy at better economics.

The team consists of a mix of machine learning scientists (ML), ML engineers, data engineers, software engineers, and data specialists. As an ML Engineer on the Content Knowledge Graph team, you will use world-class engineering and machine learning techniques on real-world, internal, and external big data to directly impact the evolution of our content catalog.

Challenges you'll tackle:

You will build and deploy robust ML/DL models that improve entity extraction, classification, resolution, and disambiguation within the CKG across multiple languages (e.g. English, Korean, etc.).

Collaborate with technical and non-technical business partners to develop analytics and metrics that describe the performance of matching systems and quality of our data.

Collaborate with data engineers, ML applied scientists, software engineering, data specialists, analytics & UX engineers to support tooling for an increasing number of CKG use cases within Netflix.

About the job

Technical support for a technology company is a big task. As the Corporate Operations Engineer within the IT Support Technician team, your mission is to enable the people and technology that keep Google running. Your team provides the front line user support for all of our internal tools and technologies. Beyond the day-to-day, the team will contribute to longer-term technical projects, process improvement and the documentation efforts that help make the Google magic happen.


As an Audio Visual Design Engineer, you will play a key role in implementing challenging and innovative AV solutions within Google. These are systems that represent areas in broadcast, custom “exhibit-style” AV systems, systems that are leveraging custom software and hardware, and public-facing spaces that have direct impact to Google and its brand.

You will be a part of a team that provides innovative solutions, at a scale that is atypical in the audio visual industry. You will be responsible for partnering with experience designers and project leads to make sure the facility vision is achievable within Google’s infrastructure, and supportable beyond the facility opening. Your goal will be to prototype, evaluate concepts, integrate within Google products and infrastructure, and guide or design technical solutions. You have experience with audio visual installations in the US and outside, and represent all design tasks and system performance criteria during conception, through prototyping and, in some cases, performance verification and programming of final installed systems.


Behind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technical Infrastructure team to keep it running. From developing and maintaining our data centers to building the next generation of Google platforms, we make Google's product portfolio possible. We're proud to be our engineers' engineers and love voiding warranties by taking things apart so we can rebuild them. We keep our networks up and running, ensuring our users have the best and fastest experience possible.

Responsibilities


Validate and translate AV Service business requirements into technical specifications and operational procedures, including assessment of development milestones and risk mitigation


Participate in prototyping, design reviews, product launch artifacts and documentation


Work with partner teams to understand Product requirements and implement technical choices according to the global demands of a distributed workplace


Ensure all solutions work within the context of Google, on our networks, and within the constraints of our security requirements

Expertise in one or more domains within the AV Engineering discipline (video, lighting, displays, audio, control programming, cloud computing, manufacturing)


Google is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace and is an affirmative action employer.

Today, most people write code by sitting at a desk, memorizing a syntax that varies with different tools, and pushing buttons. And, doing so for long periods of time is known to cause physical pain. We'd know—our client created the company after developing repetitive strain injuries (think carpal tunnel), common among people who use computers all day, that made typing incredibly painful. We're building a future where everyone can write code with the highest-bandwidth input mechanism we have: our voice.




Our mission: make programming more efficient and accessible to everyone. 
Our client would require you to be able to be at the office in San Francisco, CA.




The Role & Responsibilities




We're looking for machine learning engineers excited to apply the latest in ASR and NLP to code and build on our speech-to-code platform.




Here's a sample of projects you'd be able to work on from day 1:




Architect transformer-based neural networks to model both code and natural English.




Apply state of the art speech recognition techniques to our dataset to optimize the accuracy and performance of the product.




Build on our training pipeline, which includes automatic labeling and seamless backtesting.




Use semantic parsing techniques to enable deep understanding of user intent.




Support a wide range of speakers and environments through techniques like speaker identification and noise suppression.




Our ML Stack




Our speech-to-code engine uses state of the art deep learning served using a containerized, gRPC streaming service written in C++ for maximum performance. We've also developed our own models trained specifically for programming.




Our offline training and annotation pipelines are written using Python and PyTorch.




Whenever possible, we contribute back to the open-source community.




Join Our Team!




Maintain a Growth Mindset




We welcome hard technical challenges, and in solving them, we're continually learning from each other. We're always trying to improve ourselves and show determination in solving problems




Take Initiative




We're building a team where everyone can freely contribute and discuss ideas. We value thinking beyond just the immediate scope of what we're working on and proposing new, sometimes crazy, ideas




Communicate Directly




As a small team, direct, respectful communication is critical to our success. We aim to create an environment where everyone can vocalize their ideas and meaningfully collaborate on solutions

Develop customized strategies based on specific client requirements (video, local, shopping, maps).

Source and vet qualified writers based on client’s industry (ie - Healthcare, SaaS, Marketing Automation)

The position involves a combination of duties in programming and data analysis, along with study coordination
. Our lab seeks to identify cognitive and affective processes that are involved in the regulation of negative affect, in an effort to understand vulnerability factors for mood disorders and suicide. This work involves laboratory-based measures of brain activity (using fMRI), autonomic nervous system functioning (electrocardiogram and respiration), and behavior (executive functioning tasks and questionnaires). In addition, to understand behavior outside of the lab in the real world, we utilize ambulatory assessment to measure fluctuations in autonomic functioning (with wearables), sleep quality (with actigraphy), affect and regulation strategies (using ecological momentary assessment), and digital phenotyping approaches to measuring behavior (using smartphone keyboard metadata).

This position is ideal for a recent graduate from a Psychology, Neuroscience, Computer Science, Cognitive Science, or other STEM program who is interested in gaining clinical research experience in multimodal applied data analysis in mental health and/or neuroscience in preparation for graduate or medical school.

The is a one-year fixed term position with the possibility of renewal contingent on performance.

Duties and Responsibilities:

Data Analysis and Programming

Developing efficient data processing pipelines for psychophysiological data (e.g., heart rate variability), collected in the lab and in daily life with wearable ambulatory methods

Efficiently merging and aggregating data sets collected with multiple levels of analysis and across various time scales (e.g., millisecond, second, hourly, daily, weekly)

Developing and refining a preprocessing pipeline and building models with neuroimaging (fMRI) data

Processing psychophysiological data (e.g., heart rate variability)

Research Coordination

Employing various tools and recruitment efforts to enroll and retain young adults with major depression, suicidal ideation, or healthy controls (e.g., social media, digital advertising, referral management, advocacy outreach).

Data management and participant tracking

Conducting screenings and diagnostic interviews to assess history of psychopathology

Interacting with participants and as they participate in the study protocols (using neuroimaging, psychophysiology, ambulatory, and behavioral methods)

Assisting with other lab tasks (e.g., data entry, generating reports for data analysis)

Managing undergraduate volunteers and delegating duties efficiently

Preferred Qualifications:

Bachelor’s degree in psychology, neuroscience, computer science, cognitive science, or related field required.

Programming experience, ideally in Python, or ability to quickly learn this language.

Experience with processing fMRI and/or physiological data (e.g., Matlab, SPM, AFNI, FSL, Freesurfer, Biopac).

Proficiency with database management (e.g., merging multiple data sets from various sources) across software platforms (e.g., R, Matlab, Mplus, SPSS, Excel).

Excellent analytical skills, the ability to resolve technical or research problems (troubleshooting) and the ability to critically check data to prevent errors.

Previous experience working with human subjects and conducting independent research projects.

Knowledge and adherence of clinical research methods and design, and research protocols.

Extremely careful attention to detail (required for data entry and processing of neuroimaging, psychophysiology, ambulatory, and behavioral data).

Excellent planning, organization, and prioritization skills, with the ability to independently monitor and complete a variety of complex tasks.

Strong interpersonal skills and excellent communication, organization, presentation and computer skills.

Ability to work effectively as part of a team (e.g., share duties with other research assistants when recruiting and running study participants; complete components of data analysis, slide presentations, and manuscript and grant preparations with the PI).

Ability to complete work both remotely (e.g., computer and internet access at home) and in-person, as may be required based on pandemic guidelines.

Do you want to influence technology choices and direction? If having an immediate impact on ChowNow’s business sounds good, then we might have the perfect opportunity for you.

About the Team:

ChowNow is unique among tech startups in the restaurant space. We power branded online ordering systems for independent restaurants across North America – via websites, Facebook, Google, and through branded iOS and Android apps – and we do it all for a reasonable monthly fee regardless of order volume. We operate this way because of our belief in being fair, sustainable, and equitable with our restaurant partners. And the same goes for our workplace.

Diversity, teamwork, and mutual respect are among our core company values. And we pride ourselves on giving our teams plenty of opportunities to make their mark. To date we’ve created over 14,000 apps for our restaurant partners – something that’s never been done before in our category. And as we expand to new markets, further spreading the word about the ChowNow difference, those opportunities to create, build, and grow will only increase. If this sounds like the kind of workplace, and the kind of mission, that appeals to you, we’d love to talk.

Our passionate employees bring their authentic selves to work. Housecall Pro employees are encouraged to create employee resource groups to make the world better (think volunteering and philanthropy).
Equity in a growth stage startup backed by top-tier VCs.
Paid holidays and self-managed take-it-as-you-need-it paid time off.
Opportunity to come onboard with a team and company that is rapidly growing and create your own career path
As a DevOps Engineer, you'll be part of a technical team that architects, builds, maintains, scales, monitors, and secures the Housecall Pro cloud infrastructure. This team promotes flexibility and autonomy and will empower you with creative freedom and ownership in your work.
You will work as part of the larger Housecall Pro engineering team, collaborating to identify and implement the tooling they need to iterate the product lines rapidly and safely. Your ultimate goal is to enable engineering to help good Pros become great Pros, and you will do that by creating a solid, flexible, stable foundation that enables us to ship quickly and safely in the face of massive growth.

Qualifications
You enjoy a mixture of software engineering, site reliability engineering, automation, performance optimization, security, and operations work
High-level languages such as Ruby, Python, or JavaScript are in your suite of tools and they power automation tasks, and drive integrations with 3rd party APIs. Testing in one of these languages excites you. Accordingly, reading and reasoning about code you are not familiar with is a breeze
Linux has been part of your life for years at this point and other open-source tools are very familiar to you. Bash scripting accelerates your work. You know which tools to use to debug or optimise a misbehaving instance or container.
You have built infrastructure in a public cloud using Infrastructure as Code. You may have used tools like Terraform, CloudFormation, Pulumi, or CDK, or written directly against a cloud provider's API.
A strong familiarity with containerization tools like Docker is a must and running containers in production is second nature. You have used tools like AWS ECS, Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, or Mesos + Marathon.
You are familiar with Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment. You have automated deployment processes and created deployment pipelines. You have used tools like GitLabCI, Travis, CircleCI, etc.
You are comfortable with relational databases like MySQL or Postgres. You can optimize queries. You know when to add indexes. You understand how to run these with High Availability, and you know their limitations from experience.

A major objective of dementia research at the UCLA Easton Center is to understand the genetic risk factors for dementia and how genetics can be used to predict disease in clinical settings. We plan to achieve this by studying electronic health records (EHR) with genetics data.

The Senior Biomedical Informatician will develop and evaluate dementia phenotypes from the EHR, apply and improve genetic and clinical risk scores that predict dementia phenotypes, assess risk score performance among different ancestries, and merge and harmonize datasets from multiple sources. In this role, you will use analytical techniques from genetics, biomedical informatics, computer science and statistics. These datasets include hundreds of thousands to millions of individuals. Your analyses will be performed via local high performance clusters and cloud computing.

Qualifications

REQUIRED:

Previous research experience in electronic health records and/or human genetics

Experience with programming languages including R, SAS, Bash, SQL, Perl and/or Python

Experience running analyses on high performance computing clusters

Knowledge of Linux/Unix operating system, shell scripting, and source-code versioning systems such as GitHub

ABOUT HEAL



The current healthcare system is broken, full of friction, not accessible to the masses and treats patients as another number. At Heal, we understand that healthcare is personal, that's why we put patients front and center.



We are the undisputed market leader in doctor house calls, using technology to make experiences easy, efficient, trustworthy, and highly personal. We aim to create meaningful relationships between doctors and patients so people can worry less about the process and instead focus on their health.



In under 6 years, Heal has raised over $160m million in investment capital, delivered over 100,000 house calls and driven over $62 million in healthcare cost savings. Heal was named the 13th most disruptive private company in the U.S by the 2020 CNBC Disruptor 50 as we recently rolled out affordable flatrate Healthcare.
