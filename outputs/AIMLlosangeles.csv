Full-time position based in Pasadena, CA

OffWorld is a fifth-year robotics startup working on developing a robotic workforce for heavy industrial jobs on Earth, Moon, asteroids & Mars. OffWorld was founded by an experienced engineering team drawing on decades of tackling formidable engineering challenges at NASA, ESA, SSL/MDA, CERN, Reaction Engines, SAFRAN, Surrey Satellites, and Cisco. OffWorld’s first challenge is developing and maturing a modular robotic system for mining on Earth-our robots will go deeper underground than human miners can, eliminate the need for humans to work in life-threatening underground environments, and dramatically reduce the environmental footprint and cost of mining. Our development work is primarily funded by a customer-a forward-thinking mining company.

We have designed a modular robotic architecture that focuses on maximizing the commonality and reusability across components for fast deployment and optimization. Our robotic systems combine sensory information with cutting edge machine learning (ML) for control and decision making. We are currently looking for a Robotics Controls Software Engineer who will be responsible for implementing controls systems for autonomous navigation (SLAM) as well as closed-loop control of critical payload functions at the component and system level.

Your work will entail both design input and implementation of the modular control system architecture for our bot systems. You will be responsible for developing and integrating the controls algorithms, including sensor and actuator selection and integration, algorithm implementation, and integration and test at the component and system level. The work will focus on the implementation of robust intrinsically safe components, with maximum levels of reliability, performance, and efficiency. You will be responsible for the design, development, and integration of autonomous navigation modules for our mobility platform as well as the development of closed-loop control, including computer vision-based algorithms for payload systems. Immediate projects you will work on include: integration of motion planning and collision avoidance software modules in ROS, simulation development, and testing in Gazebo, sensor and actuator integration, and unit, component, subsystem, and system-level testing in the field & development of closed-loop control for autonomous payload functions.

To hit the ground running, you need:

MSc or higher in aerospace engineering, mechanical engineering, robotics, mechatronics, computer science or equivalent

Practical experience with the design and implementation of software controls modules for autonomous mobility for EVs, drones, or robotic arms (past industry position or internship); power & electronics systems integration is a plus

Practical experience with the design and implementation of algorithms for a range of problems in motion planning, localization, and classical computer vision in Python/C++

Proficiency in coordinate transforms, linear algebra, sensor integration, and calibration.

Experience working with open source libraries like OpenCV, PCL, and MoveiT

Extensive knowledge of ROS, Python, C++, and Matlab/Simulink.. Python and ROS proficiency is a must.

Familiarity with Linux operating system, Embedded Software, Assembly, machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning is a plus

Ability to effectively collaborate and communicate with your peers while maintaining a friendly, safe, and accepting environment.

Nothing-is-impossible attitude

In a nutshell, we offer

Opportunity to sink your teeth into cutting edge industrial robotics problems

Opportunity to contribute to the mission of transforming how we mine on Earth today and how we will one day mine on the Moon, asteroids & Mars

Opportunity to attend relevant conferences in the line of research

Competitive package

Offer to join the OffWorld team full-time-if

You are as crazy-excited about the mission as we are

You’ve demonstrated you are The Right Stuff

Agile Scrum Certification – has been a Scrum Master in more than one previous positions


2+ Office Suite: PowerPoint, Excel


Experience with Azure DevOps (Can be Jira) as a tracking tool: create user stories manage projects.


Understanding of Power BI – not doing anything in the tool but coaching a team that is data modeling and developing and building data modules in it. So they would be managing a team using it – they should be literate in data. Don’t need to do left, right, or outer joins.


Understanding of visualization tools – Tableau – building reports, building joins, business objects


There is an offshore component in the Philippines - daily stand up with them at 3:30 PM. So, someone who has been a Scrum Master with an offshore team is important.




PLUSSES:




1. VERY HELPFUL – prior utility experience – having this vocabulary will be helpful




2. Huge plus: Developer background and data analyst background




3. Worked on a team with Software Development and work with other IT teams and understand what they do. Make sure they are solving whatever the user stories are for that sprint.




4. Been in companies that are political – especially where a bunch of teams are Agile but not all. So working cross-functionally with all those competing process.




5. Experience with SAP Security / Basis (SAP platform) interaction – a lot of impediments/blocks come from this due to lack of communication




6. Analytics Team Scrum Master: SAP HANA (Database technology)




7. Information Steward: catalogs and stores all data – can look at the data, see service orders,

Amazon is developing a consumer-facing AI product that will help Amazon Studios create exciting movie experiences and make content accessible to more Prime Video customers. It presents a unique opportunity to work on cutting-edge AI technology in the entertainment and media industry, backed by the resources and expertise of one of the world’s leading tech companies. Unfortunately we can’t share any details about the program because it is under a strict NDA. This project has been approved at the highest levels of the company because its innovation has the potential to disrupt several large industries. We expect it to have a global launch and be enjoyed by customers all over the world. When it launches, you won’t need to tell your friends and family about it --- they will message you to see if you’ve heard about the very cool thing Amazon just released.


Amazon’s vision is to be Earth’s most consumer-centric company. You will work within a new but highly specialized team that aims to change the fundamental way studios operates, creating solutions that delight our customers and partners. You will take a hands-on approach to designing and implementing a new generation of Studios Technology.


You will be responsible for solving big problems where answers need to be invented and roads are not yet paved. In order to meet our customer’s high standards we hold each other and ourselves to higher standards. You will join a friendly culture filled with teammates that are really smart who encourage each other to learn more. We value diverse perspectives and are seeking engineers that can challenge unconscious bias while also working to disconfirm their own beliefs.


To be a successful candidate you need to be motivated by putting your customers first. You don’t rest until the customer is happy. You have a strong technical background, are detail driven and have excellent problem-solving skills. You are self-motivated, a constant learner and always curious about how things work. You are constantly trying to improve processes, solutions, and yourself. You learn from your mistakes and you enjoy collaborating with others. You have a solid understanding of software fundamentals and an appreciation of how an IT ecosystem functions.


As a Senior Software Development Manager, you will have technical ownership of the development and sustainability of new applications that drive studio innovations. This is a new and exciting group and you'll be challenged to change the way an entire industry thinks about technology and then, disrupt it. You'll lead a strategic program within Amazon Studios Tech and will be a leader of leaders. Successful candidates will be strong leaders who can prioritize well, communicate clearly, and have a consistent track record of delivery. The Amazon Studios business requires creative engineering balanced with high quality and internal customer focus.

Metropolis is an AI and computer vision start-up building the technological and real estate infrastructure to facilitate the future of mobility.



Your opportunity



This is your opportunity to join early and build something remarkable at the intersection of technology, mobility, and real estate. We are reimagining the parking experience today but developing an ecosystem to support all forms of mobility tomorrow; and if you have a passion for transforming the urban landscape to more intelligently facilitate EV charging, last mile transport, autonomous vehicles, and even electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL), please consider joining us.



Our team



The Company is led by an experienced executive team with diverse backgrounds, including a successful LA-based tech founder, a technical leader from eHarmony and DogVacay, and senior professionals from major global financial services firms and the world's leading mobility companies; our first-class engineering talent joins us from Facebook, Palantir, Bird, Factual, Honey, Canoo, and others.



We approach life with wonder and curiosity. We're inventors, skeptics and, at times, have been called crazy. We challenge one another with passion, from principle and with respect. But above all, we are relentless in our drive to build a collaborative, diverse, and inclusive culture.



The role



Metropolis is seeking a Machine Learning Engineer to lead the development of our computer vision algorithms that would be used to power our mobility services. Reporting to the Director of Machine Learning, you will be responsible for the development, deployment and ongoing optimization of the models that would be at the core of our platform. The models you build will need to detect objects, track its direction of motion and more, and do all that in near-real time. This is a challenging opportunity because the models you build will need to be optimized for different conditions like indoors and outdoors, lighting, weather and field of view. If you have a background in sensors and computer vision, and are interested in mobility, autonomous vehicles, computer vision or machine learning, this is the ideal opportunity for you.



When you join Metropolis, you'll join a team of world-class product leaders and engineers, building an ecosystem of technologies at the intersection of parking, mobility, and real estate. Our goal is to build an inclusive culture where everyone has a voice and the best idea wins. You will play a key role in building and maintaining this culture as our organization grows.

Collaborate with the application development team to integrate the computer vision models with the existing backend systems.


Work with analytics engineers, application developers and third-party resources to analyze the efficacy of the models.


Work with the Product team to understand the complex business rules and figure out how to optimize the ML-generated output to satisfy those requirements.


Problem solve, think big, and explore divergent concepts/ideas while understanding how to converge and build iteratively towards the goals of the Machine Learning team.


Inspire the entire team (including your cross-functional) partners by bringing new ideas to the table.


Help with hiring and onboarding of engineers to the Machine Learning team.




Requirements and Qualifications

Enstoa is a global thought and practice leader in the digital transformation of managing construction and facilities for health care, natural resources, real estate, and public infrastructure. According to the G20-backed Global Infrastructure Hub, the world needs $94 trillion spent on infrastructure by 2040. This demand with constraints like a labor crunch and increased regulatory requirements are creating massive challenges for company executives. These forces are inspiring many to take a fresh look at how the built environment is developed and operated.



Enstoa gets it and has achieved something rare. As the only company that focuses exclusively on accelerated digital transformation for the built environment, Enstoa introduces entirely new ways of workingâ€”ways that can eliminate time and cost from the process. Ways that empower the people who create and maintain the built environment to spend less time chasing down information and more time using it. Enstoa's success is based on use of multidisciplinary project teams which combine built-environment subject matter expertise together with expertise in organizational change, system implementation, integration, data modelling, data analysis and AI/ML.

Traditionally, women were given a choice between two options when it came to their bras and underwear: Be sexy, or be comfortable. Our Cofounders: Heidi Zak, Dave Spector, and Ra'el Cohen, thought that was outdated too â€” so, in 2013, they created ThirdLove â€” a third, better option, which doesn't force us to choose between being sexy or comfortable. We can just look and feel our best, whatever that means to us. We are the brand that disrupted the lingerie industry by empowering women to find their perfect fit online with our innovative Fit FinderÂ® quiz. Inclusivity is at the core of who we are and how we serve our customers and build our team.

TL;DR:



The Platform Architect is tasked with overseeing the creation of a platform and corresponding organizational and cultural changes needed to help the platform become sustainable by the client.



As a trusted partner to our clients, you’ll be pushing the organization forward while helping them solve difficult technology problems. You will foster an environment that empowers teams and facilitates the development of your team members, setting everyone up to deliver their best work.

Full Description:



The Thoughtworks 
Digital Platform Strategy (DPS)
 offers a holistic approach unleashing the power an enterprise already possesses. By combining tailored platform solutions with powerful strategic guidance, we collaborate with our partners to build and execute on a strategy to facilitate innovation, reduce time to market, and deliver unique competitive advantage.



As Platform Architect here's what we'll be looking for you to bring:




Basic understanding of the following areas:


Public cloud service offerings (IaaS, PaaS, DBaaS services as well high level product offerings such, as AWS Sagemaker, Cognito, GuardDuty)


Infrastructure as Software (Container Orchestration, Observability, CI/CD)

Modern security practices


Modern API platform design


Modern data architectures (e.g. event driven architectures, data democratization, platform approaches to support ML/AI at scale, stream processing, and integrating real time analytics into customer applications)


Organizational skills and consulting abilities that:


Develop and evolve technology strategy, aligned to and prioritized by business objectives

Influence / coach enterprise architecture on modern evolutionary platform architecture principles and practices


Develop and communicate measurements of platform progress and business impact


Support organizational changes in regards to capability development, restructuring toward product-centric team models, and transitioning to modern agile SDLC practices


Communicate technical decisions to non-technical audiences and build consensus around them


Articulate the value of foundational technology approaches to business executives (e.g. the pros & cons of microservices architectures in a given context)


Own key relationships both up and downstream of the platform teams to ensure delivery.


Manage priorities and make decisions in high stakes scenarios


You understand that leadership is not something you do from far away; you get the importance of taking people with you along the journey and are able to influence and coach those around you to orchestrate team success.


You understand that not every client can effectively utilize sophisticated technologies or new tools tools and prefer to choose solutions that are appropriate for an organization’s capability, cost-sensitivity, and risk tolerance.




There's no typical day or engagement for our Platform Architects. Here’s what you’ll do:




Assess the ongoing success of the platform efforts and report the progress to the client services team and the DPS team.


Guide delivery programs with one or more business applications which will be drivers for the emerging delivery infrastructure and API platforms.


Strategize with the client and ThoughtWorks subject matter experts on creating and combining elements of a platform, and ensure delivery against it.


Be responsible for engaging with technical and business stakeholders to understand clients’ needs, prioritize the delivery approach, and guide technical leads in solution delivery.


Evangelize business benefits and impact of the platform as well as the value of modern delivery and engineering practices.


Support client architects and portfolio managers in developing technology roadmaps, including effectively evaluating build/rent/buy decisions.


Perform account management activities, such as delivery assurance and helping shape new engagements.




A few important things to know:



While we’ve traditionally been a traveling consultancy, travel is not required for this role at the moment. We anticipate the need for travel to our client locations in the future when it’s deemed safe.

Would you like a career that gives you opportunities to help Media and Entertainment (M&E) customers leverage the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform? Are you obsessed with bringing digital transformation to video and content workloads in the cloud? Do you like to work on a variety of cloud services, building and implementing solutions on top of the AWS platform? Are you a passionate learner about Cloud technologies? Are you constantly exploring/improving cutting edge solutions in the Cloud? Do you love to write code and automate processes?


AWS is looking for experienced Application Architects, who have developed and maintained software in production environments, to help M&E customers accelerate their own success in the AWS Cloud.

This is an excellent opportunity to join AWS’s world class technical teams, working with some of the best and brightest engineers while also developing your skills and furthering your career within one of the most innovative and progressive technology companies.

Application Architects on our team have 6+ years of software development experience typically with 2+ years of video based workflow experience.


Our team puts a high value on work-life balance. It isn’t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and locations, and we encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives.

What you’ll do:




Develop solutions built on top of AWS core products for core video and media workloads.


Write production grade code in several languages.


Contribute software and “Infrastructure as Code” into a CI/CD pipeline, along with documentation, to allow us to hand over the solution to the customer.


Participate in pre-sale customer evaluations and discussions as a subject matter expert on AWS solutions.


Work with other technical teams, to ensure solutions are well-architected and can be successfully delivered.

Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 16 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.


Work/Life Balance

Our team puts a high value on work-life harmony. Striking a healthy balance between your personal and professional life is crucial to your happiness and success here. We are a customer-obsessed organization—leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. As such, this is a customer facing role in a hybrid delivery model. Project engagements include remote delivery methods and onsite engagement that will include travel to customer locations as needed.

OffWorld is a fifth-year robotics startup working on developing a robotic workforce for heavy industrial jobs on Earth, Moon, asteroids & Mars. OffWorld was founded by an experienced engineering team drawing on decades of tackling formidable engineering challenges at NASA, ESA, SSL/MDA, CERN, Reaction Engines, SAFRAN, Surrey Satellites and Cisco. OffWorld’s first challenge is developing and maturing a modular robotic system for extreme environment applications on Earth-our robots will go deeper underground than humans can, eliminate the need for humans to work in life-threatening environments in construction, tunneling and other dangerous applications and dramatically reduce the environmental footprint and cost in key industrial sectors.

We have designed a modular robotic architecture that focuses on maximizing the commonality and reusability across components for fast deployment and optimization. Our robotic systems combine sensory information with cutting edge machine learning (ML) for control and decision making.

OffWorld is seeking a talented and motivated Senior Powertrain Mechanical Engineer to join a fast-moving team working to create advanced robot systems. You will be responsible for the requirement definition, design, development, integration, and validation of a mobility system for robots travelling in rough terrains. This includes mechanical component selection & integration, system build supervision and frequent hands-on work in the lab, all the way to working on fully integrated robots in the field.

A successful candidate must demonstrate the ability to work in a team along with the required communication skills to effectively interact with other engineers.

To hit the ground running, you need:

MSc or higher in Mechanical Engineering, robotics, mechatronics or equivalent with 5+ years of industry experience.

Practical experience with the design and implementation of end-to-end electric powertrains for EVs, robots or industrial machinery (past industry position).

Practical experience with common powertrain failure modes and their corresponding preventative measures.

Extensive experience with the design of mechanical power transmission systems for wheeled or tracked systems including gears, bearings, and axles.

Extensive experience with SolidWorks or other MCAD software.

Experience with mechanical simulation software (Abaqus, Solidworks, Matlab/Simulink, etc.).

Experience with the implementation of suspensions for wheeled or tracked systems.

Experience with Ingress Protection ratings, material selection, and industrial design practices.

Experience with thermal system design (forced air, liquid cooling).

Practical experience with identifying and solving integration and packaging problems.

Experience with machining parts and the use of a mill, lathe, CNC machine, welding equipment, water/laser jets, etc.

Familiarity with ROS, Python, C/C++ programming, firmware development, CAN bus experience is a plus.

Nothing-is-impossible attitude.

In a nutshell, we offer

Opportunity to sink your teeth into cutting edge industrial robotics problems

Opportunity to contribute to the mission of transforming how we operate in extreme environments on Earth today and how we will one day do so on the Moon, asteroids & Mars

Opportunity to attend relevant conferences in the line of research

Competitive package

In today's world, customers expect companies to know who they are and what they want. Customers want to have products, services or experiences that best suit their needs delivered to them seamlessly across physical and digital channels.

Customers are human first: driven by dynamic wants, needs, and desires. The ability for brands to make personal, meaningful connections on a human level has never been greater and Hux by Deloitte Digital delivers on those experiences in a way that allows companies to own the customer journey end to end.

Hux is the Human Experience Platform by Deloitte Digital. We help companies connect key data sources to understand what matters most to people; connect to advanced technologies like AI and machine learning to sense and respond to those needs at scale; and connect their systems to unlock insights, create collaboration and drive acquisition, engagement and loyalty. Most importantly, we empower companies to connect with customers in personal, meaningful ways that respect them as people, not just customers.

Hux by Deloitte Digital gives companies the ability to build and leverage the connections - between people, systems, data and technologies - so they can deliver personalized, contextual experiences to customers at scale.

We are seeking to transform the way brands interact with their customers and elevate the human experience.

Here at Raytheon Technologies, we work together as one global team creating trusted, innovative solutions to make the world a safer place. Our innovation spans all domains: from land and sea to air, space and cyberspace.

Raytheon Intelligence & Space is driving a transformation in its Business Development and Engineering organizations with the goal to increase intimacy throughout the customer lifecycle including Agile DevOps and rapid prototyping. The Engineering organization believes Solutions Architects play a pivotal role in this transformation based on 3 essential market factors. First, Solutions Architects are a critical factor in enabling government contractors to synchronize the pace of technology development across a broad spectrum of customers, some who are comfortable with a longer, more deliberate procurement pace while others are anxious to rapidly advance procurement processes and outcomes. Second, Raytheon is looking to adapt a quicker pace of technology development to meet or exceed the increased pace that the government is adopting based on the influx of commercial organizations and commercial technology development models. Finally, the changing demographics of the emerging engineering workforce dictates that government contractors need to evaluate models and strategies that account for the greater variability and mobility of Solutions Architects and other key members of the Engineering team.

Your Mission



SADA is seeking an experienced Cloud Technical Writer who understands complex cloud computing topics and concepts, but is also a skilled writer who can abstract those topics and concepts and turn them into a compelling narrative. This role will be largely responsible for developing our engineering blog, working in collaboration with our engineers to document our innovative solutions, and showcasing our engineering culture and expertise. You'll provide valuable information to the broader tech community around best practices and industry trends, sourcing ideas from the engineering organization that range from how we built something to how we work to our vision for the future. In addition to your work on the engineering blog, you'll deliver high-quality, well-organized thought-leadership content that is technical, but still accessible to a non-developer, tech savvy audience. You'll produce content in a range of formats including technical tutorials, deep dives, blogs, white papers, and more.



As a Google Cloud Premier partner, SADA helps organizations harness the immense power of Google Cloud's leading infrastructure, platform capabilities and industry solutions to solve business challenges. In this role, you will be challenged to be creative, think big, and educate our audience on how they can use Google Cloud solutions to address their needs. You will work closely with our marketing, sales, engineering and technology teams to translate technical features of Google Cloud solutions and offerings into inspiring content that takes into account product positioning, messaging, and value propositions.



Primary job responsibilities include:




Drafting compelling, clear, concise, and accurate public-facing content and materials that align with SADA's content marketing strategy (blogs, tutorials, eBooks, guides, white papers, data sheets)


Serving as the primary writer, editor, and strategist for engineering blog content, taking input from engineering leadership to understand priorities, working directly with engineers to develop posts, managing an editorial calendar and pipeline, and coordinating with the content marketing team to ensure posts fit into the broader SADA narrative


Collaborating with and interviewing Product Managers, Business Development Managers, Solution Architects, Engineers, and other SADA and Google Cloud technical resources to show our audience what our in-house teams are actually working on, telling their stories in a clear, compelling way


Drafting educational content that helps our audience learn about a specific topic/technology, and walk readers through how our team applied the topic/technology to work through a challenge


Reviewing and correcting material for content, style, and compliance with internal and external standards


Reviewing final documents for accuracy and content completeness and editing content submitted by our subject matter experts to meet our quality bar without drowning out the voice of the writer


Keeping your finger on the pulse of our internal engineering culture, researching industry trends and staying up to date with the latest product and solution information


Continuously curating, growing, and updating our content and resource library


Adding metadata/labels to improve searchability




Pathway to Success



#BeOneStepAhead: At SADA, we are in the business of digital transformation. We are focused on leading-edge technology that is ever-evolving. We embrace change enthusiastically and encourage agility. This means that not only do our teams know that change is inevitable, but they embrace this change to continuously expand their skills, preparing for future customer needs.



Your success starts by positively impacting the direction of a fast-growing practice with vision and passion. You will be measured quarterly by the breadth, magnitude, and quality of your contributions, your ability to estimate accurately, how well you collaborate with your peers, and the consultative polish you bring to customer and alliance partner interactions.



Expectations



Training - Ongoing with first-week orientation at HQ followed by a 90-day onboarding schedule. Details of the timeline can be shared. 
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all onboarding will be temporarily conducted remotely.
