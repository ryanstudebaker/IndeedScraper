As one of Scale's Operations product managers, you'll be designing and building new solutions, tools, and processes to solve new problems that arise as we grow. We are growing operations rapidly and on-boarding new customers and launching products all the time. This raises new strategic questions we need to answer as well as tactical challenges we need to overcome.
You will be part of a team of cross-functional communicators and collaborators who will shape our operations products and solutions. You are relentless in driving stellar product and process designs, running pilots, tests, and experiments, then hand over new designs to a team of skilled operators.
The blend of strategy, implementation, and design make this a unique and exciting role that will provide an opportunity to work with multiple teams (e.g., Engineering, Marketing, Operations, Analytics, and several others) across the company and around the globe.
The ideal candidate is scrappy, analytical, outcome-focused, and above all a leader who gets and inspires results.
You will:
Build & Iterate: 
 Design new processes and tools and drive their implementation across the organization within the US and globally. Collaborate with stakeholders to improve processes for new and existing customers.
Analyze & Experiment: 
Use quantitative experimentation to derive result-oriented actions for user acquisition, retention, experience, and performance.
Plan & Strategize: 
 Problem solve some of our most pressing strategic operations challenges.
Work cross-functionally: 
 Partner with Product teams to drive step-function changes in how we can scale operations. Build, maintain, and regularly communicate detailed reporting for other leaders across the company who will use your team's data to inform their own operations and strategy.
Ideally you’d have:
2-3+ years of industry experience in an operational role and/or 1+ years in a top-tier consulting firm.
An undergraduate from a top university in an analytics heavy major (e.g., Engineering or Economics) and/or a graduate degree from a top university in Engineering, Economics, or Business.
Experience leading and influencing without authority.
An entrepreneurial mindset that balances creative problem solving with the desire to run through walls to deliver outcomes.
Analytical, planning, and process-building experience.
Nice to Have:
Work Experience with Product Management, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision or Natural Language Processing.
Coding experience

As one of Scale's product operations managers, you'll be designing and building new solutions, tools, and processes to solve new problems that arise as we grow. We are growing operations rapidly and on-boarding new customers and launching products all the time. This raises new strategic questions we need to answer as well as tactical challenges we need to overcome.




We are looking for a senior product operations manager to lead and develop best in class labeling systems for the operations team. You will be part of a team of cross functional communicators and collaborators who will shape our operations products and solutions. You are relentless in driving stellar product and process designs, running pilots, tests, and experiments, then hand over new designs to a team of skilled operators.




The blend of strategy, implementation, and design make this a unique and exciting role that will provide an opportunity to work with multiple teams (e.g., Engineering, Marketing, Operations, Analytics, and several others) across the company and around the globe.

The ideal candidate is scrappy, analytical, outcome focused, and above all a leader who gets and inspires results.

You will:

Strategize & Lead: 
Problem solve some of our most pressing strategic operations challenges, and lead teams to deliver results

Analyze & Experiment: 
Use quantitative experimentation to derive result-oriented actions for user acquisition, retention, experience, and performance.

Build & Iterate:
 Design new processes and tools and drive their implementation across the organization within the US and globally. Collaborate with stakeholders to improve processes for new and existing customers.

Work cross-functionally: 
Partner with Product teams to drive step-function changes in how we can scale operations. Build, maintain, and regularly communicate detailed reporting for other leaders across the company who will use your team's data to inform their own operations and strategy.

Ideally you’d have:

5+ years of industry experience in an operational role and/or 3+ years in a top tier consulting firm.

1+ years of direct managing experience.

An undergraduate from a top university in an analytics heavy major (e.g., Engineering or Economics) and/or a graduate degree from a top university in Engineering, Economics, or Business.

Experience leading and influencing without authority.

An entrepreneurial mindset that balances creative problem solving with the desire to run through walls to deliver outcomes.

Analytical, planning, and process building capability.

Amplitude's mission is to help companies build better products. By building best-in-class teams, we create best-in-class products that customers love. We approach challenges with humility, we take ownership over our work, and our growth mindset pushes us to constantly improve ourselves, each other, and the value we bring to customers.



As a Product Operations Manager, you will work closely with the Head of Product Operations to both define and execute the Product Operations team's mandate. In doing so, you will work across functions to improve and support key product development processes with the goal of providing seamless experience for our internal teams and, in turn, our customers.



As a Product Operations Manager, you will:




Own and operationalize new cross-functional product processes that help drive alignment and deliver value to the business and to customers


Partner with the Support, Product Marketing, and Product team to create and maintain documentation that serves as the ""source of truth"" for the broader organization to enable a consistent customer experience across touchpoints

Operationalize improvements for how the product development team builds and ships products


Strategize and optimize how our product teams operate by supporting Product Leaders and Product Managers with analyses and process improvements


Operationalize feature rollouts in partnership with Product, Product Marketing, and Support teams to take products from ideation to GA




You'll be a great addition to the team if you have:




You have 5+ years of experience working in tech, in consulting or in similar fields


You have a track record of successfully executing complex cross-functional projects involving multiple stakeholders


You have worked closely with a product team before and have implemented processes that improved how they build and ship products


You are nimble and resourceful; you can just as easily complete an ad-hoc request from Support or Sales as you can execute a recurring product process


You have facilitated executive workshops that have driven key outcomes


You can solve a problem by getting deep in the weeds, but you can also zoom out and see the bigger picture


You are humble, positive and customer-obsessed

Job Description

Visa recognizes that operating a successful company is about much more than delivering strong returns to shareholders. We strive to make a positive, and ideally transformative impact on the world, based on the belief that doing well can and should mean doing good, particularly for a global organization like Visa whose business is connecting the world to enable people, businesses, and economies to thrive.

Through our social impact mission to be a force for good that advances inclusive and equitable economic growth for everyone everywhere, we are focused on helping small and micro businesses (SMB) thrive and engaging locally to strengthen communities. Especially in this post COVID19 world, SMBs need support to recover, build resiliency and grow. By harnessing our capital, our assets, our products/services, our people, and our knowledge, we are focused on helping set millions of SMBs globally on a path to growth. We see small and micro businesses as the backbone of the global economy, and our goal is to empower these enterprises, help them transition into this new world, and improve their livelihoods, ultimately creating a ripple effect throughout their communities.

These efforts build on the strong legacy of social impact Visa has created through corporate giving, financial inclusion, and financial education.

Square builds common business tools in unconventional ways so more people can start, run, and grow their businesses. When Square started, it was difficult and expensive (or just plain impossible) for some businesses to take credit cards. Square made credit card payments possible for all by turning a mobile phone into a credit card reader. Since then Square has been building an entire business toolkit of both hardware and software products including Square Capital, Square Terminal, Square Payroll, and more. We’re working to find new and better ways to help businesses succeed on their own terms—and we’re looking for people like you to help shape tomorrow at Square.

Rupa
 makes lab testing simple. We turn an archaic 15 hour-a-week process into a delightful 15 min task for doctors, nurses, and even acupuncturists ordering lab testing for their patients.

Lab testing is the key to a more personalized and holistic approach to medicine, and Rupa is paving the way with critical infrastructure for this next generation of healthcare. Through Rupa, practitioners can order testing not available through the average hospital, such as DNA testing, microbiome testing, advanced fertility and hormone testing, and more.

This comprehensive and personalized approach to healthcare is the missing piece for the millions of people suffering from complex, chronic health conditions. Rather than band-aid solutions, our providers strive to understand, diagnose, and treat the root cause of people’s health issues. At Rupa, we are building the infrastructure to make this root-cause approach the standard of care for every person on the planet.

Starting with lab testing, Rupa is bringing tools and resources to trailblazing practitioners who are practicing medicine in a way that truly helps people get well.

 Our Supporters - We're grateful to be backed by world class investors and advisors.




We’re backed by and work closely with our world class investors:
 
First Round Capital, Floodgate (Mike Maples), SV Angel (Ron Conway), Lachy Groom, Trae Vassallo (Defy), healthcare domain experts, former founders with successful exits, the product brains behind Gmail, Facebook newsfeed, Dropbox, and more.




We’re also fortunate to be advised by the best in the industry, including the Head of Health and co-founder of IDEO, the co-founder of Honor HomeCare, domain experts with backgrounds from Harvard, Stanford, MIT, Johns Hopkins, and more.




We’ve been growing like crazy over the past year and a company is only as good as its people, and so we’re looking for Rupa’s first Partner Operations Manager who can join us on this fast-paced journey.

 The Opportunity - A day in the life of a Partner Operations Manager at Rupa.

Rupa links practitioners to laboratories that run tests to help them diagnose and treat patients. We're looking for a collaborative strategic thinker to help us expand, deepen, and streamline the ways we work with our lab provider partners.

As the first Partner Operations Manager at Rupa, you'll own the lab account management function and be in charge of developing and managing key, business-critical relationships with our partner labs. This includes:

Managing key lab account relationships as the main point of contact
Delighting our lab partners and building strong connections that demonstrate the power of Rupa to accelerate the lab’s business
Working with our product & product ops team to get them what they need from the labs
Scoping, negotiating, and managing technical integrations and operational process improvements with labs
Discovering, evaluating, and prioritizing new product offerings for lab partners

We’re a close-knit, scrappy, and hardworking team, and that means we’re looking for talented relationship-builders who can offer more than just customer support or process management. There’s a lot of unexplored territory in this space, and we’ll be relying on your ingenuity and problem-solving skills to come up with novel solutions that can help us deliver more value more efficiently for everyone in our ecosystem. We’ll also be looking for you to provide your insights on product direction and company strategy.


 Does this sound like you?! ️

At least 2 years of management consulting, private equity, business development, customer success, or partnerships experience. You are hardworking, a fast learner, and a creative problem solver. You excel at taking ambiguous problems, breaking them down, and solving them without every aspect being laid out for you.

Strong negotiation and relationship building skills. You know how to build win-win-win solutions and craft the right story for any situation. You're personable and aren't afraid to dive into tough conversations.

Exceptional communication skills: this role, by its nature, is cross-functional and you'll spend a lot of time working with both external and internal (product, operations, design, engineering) counterparts.

Detail-oriented: you're working with products and processes as much as you are with people, and if you don't get the little things right it's like a rock in your shoe. If you sweat the minor stuff, you'll be rewarded!

Data proficient: data helps us understand if we're moving in the right direction, so you should be able to not just retrieve data but define what metrics matter and, more importantly, which ones don't

Growth mindset: this is a fast-moving, early-stage company and we adapt our priorities to resource constraints and market needs. You'll need to be open to learning new things, getting things wrong in smart ways, and rapidly iterating.

Experience working in other early-stage tech startups.

A passion for functional medicine and creating the infrastructure for the future of healthcare.


 Our Rupa Team - The best part of this whole journey!

You’ll be joining our all-star core team who have 10+ years experience in the space, have won awards for their biotech research, worked hands on with chronically ill patients, built multiple multi-billion-dollar companies, and much more. The core team comes from Stanford, Wharton, Y Combinator, Parsley Health, Lululemon, Everlywell, Square, Forward, and more. We each have very personal reasons for wanting to transform this space. We’ve experienced firsthand the impact personalized medicine can have and are committed to this cause.

Beyond our collective excitement for the space, we’re a super close team who values personal development, being active, growth mindsets, a great sense of humor, and a healthy balance of optimism and realism. We work hard, care about each other, and have a ton of fun.

If this sounds like you, we’re stoked to meet you!

Work with EPM, Product and Commerce teams to be sure all requirements are clearly defined and requested in advance of and maintain presence during marquee events

Work with analytics and reporting teams to gather metrics for user data

Report on user projections (viewing, commerce) and communicate scaling needs to appropriate teams

Communicate monitoring expectations and incident management objective adherence

Maintain a clear overview of project timelines (gantt charts, spreadsheets, etc.) and progress using task management tools (primarily Jira).

Drive event checklist, identify possible issues and clearly communicate them to project stakeholders.

Act as voice of Media Operations workstreams amongst internal and third-party groups.

We are building the most compelling way to rent a car by committing to relentless customer centricity, technology-powered operational excellence, and capital efficiency. With our vision of 
giving people better access to fewer cars
, we saw record growth throughout COVID19, and are now doubling down on gaining market share with our recent raise of more than $9M in venture funding from some of the best investors in the industry (amongst others: investors in Auto 1, Bird, Lime, DoorDash, Flexport, and Slack).
At Kyte, we love what we do and we believe our diverse team of ridiculously ambitious individuals is what makes our company great. Together, we are mobility enthusiasts that have an assortment of wide-ranging backgrounds from Stanford, Berkeley, MIT, TUM, Uber, BMW, McKinsey, and others. We are headquartered in the sunny, San Francisco Marina district where we enjoy Bay views, good food, and a proper sound system for those late night working sessions. We have opened our second home strategically close to Oktoberfest in Munich, just 5 min from the Central Station in the beautiful district of Nymphenburg.
We offer competitive compensation, significant equity, and the ability to shape a big vision from early on. We are laser focused on bringing on talented individuals that are aligned with our vision and mission, to create a magical rental car experience from end to end. You will have more than significant ownership and impact on our company trajectory, and shape how people get around the cities they live in. We look forward to hearing from you!
About the role
We are excited to grow our supply team at Kyte and looking to bring on new team members. We’re seeking a highly motivated individual with a strong operational and start-up background that wants to disrupt the way people travel. The role is highly cross-functional, involving coordination across a number of groups within Kyte, including finance, supply, product, and operations. In other words, you will sit in the “control tower” and get exposure to all parts of the business. Successful candidates will have a passion for transportation/travel, exceptional analytical skills, bias toward action, exceptional organizational and communication skills. We move quickly as a team to drive company wide decisions, thus a balance getting the details right while still moving fast is important.
General Requirements
You like to take ownership when solving problems
: We believe in extreme ownership and look for people who will make decisions as if it were their own company.
Develop a strong and sustainable partnership network: 
 Based on our strategy, it is your task to identify, benchmark and acquire service providers that best suit our vision.

If our partners do not perform in the desired way, it is your task to independently escalate and steer the cooperation into the right direction.
Support development of disruptive changes: 
 You will develop and implement proprietary tools to orchestrate a complex network of suppliers and internal stakeholders in order to bring automation into a world mostly dominated by manual and repetitive processes and tasks.

Uber is committing to become a fully zero-emission platform by 2040, with 100% of rides taking place in zero-emission vehicles, on public transit, or with micro-mobility. We're also setting an earlier goal to have 100% of rides take place in electric vehicles (EVs) in US, Canadian, and European cities by 2030 (external commitment).

These are very ambitious goals, and hitting them would put us a decade ahead of the Paris Climate Agreement targets. This position will play a critical role in this initiative - understand the challenges facing EV adoption and work with several partners to overcome them at scale.

You'll collaborate cross-functionally across product, cities, finance, marketing, tax, legal, and customer support. We are looking for an outstanding project manager with intimate product understanding who is able to coordinate across all these groups to deliver successful regional strategies and execution plans. The ideal candidate possesses superb analytical skills and is also passionate about engaging senior stakeholders and external groups to drive large-scale impact in the US and Canada to shape and execute our electrification strategy.

What You'll Do

Work to support Uber's transition to a zero-emission fleet.

Build and run EV programs for drivers:

Launch new EV products for drivers with OEMs, charging infrastructure companies, financiers, and other players in the ecosystem. This includes go-to-market operations and B2B support.

Support and expand existing EV programs that deliver incremental and strategic value to Uber. This will be in close partnership with product, operations, marketing, and finance.

Identify, analyze, and troubleshoot barriers to growth through data-driven insights then implement solutions.

Basic Qualifications

Bachelor's degree required

4+ years of entrepreneurial, investment banking, or operating experience in high-growth environments.

Preferred Qualifications

Self-motivated, ability to work independently in an ambiguous environment.

Strong project management skills. The ability to prioritize and successfully drive a project from beginning to end and to work across multiple projects simultaneously.

Strong partner management skills, with experience working with cross-functional teams in large organizations in developing and operationalizing initiatives.

Strong analytical and critical thinking skills, and a demonstrated ability to problem solve in a new and unfamiliar environment

Industry experience with electric vehicles, charging infrastructure or utilities is great but not required.

At Uber, we ignite opportunity by setting the world in motion. We take on big problems to help drivers, riders, delivery partners, and eaters get moving in more than 10,000 cities around the world.

We welcome people from all backgrounds who seek the opportunity to help build a future where everyone and everything can move independently. If you have the curiosity, passion, and collaborative spirit, work with us, and let's move the world forward, together.

Loom is on a mission to empower everyone at work to communicate more effectively, wherever they are. We are already trusted by over 10M users across 120k+ companies. Our customers are global and use Loom at work at world-class companies including Netflix, HubSpot, Atlassian, Juniper Networks, and Twitter.

Founded in 2015, Loom has raised over $200 million from top-tier investors including Sequoia Capital, Kleiner Perkins, Coatue, and Andreessen Horowitz.

The Role:

We are looking for someone who will be a key cross-functional Loommate and take on some of Loom's most urgent, cross-functional business strategy and operational projects. As a hire on a small team, you will work collaboratively across Engineering, Product, Go-to-market, and Ops teams on a variety of strategic and operational initiatives. You will be digging through data, identifying actionable insights, scoping out project plans and driving the cross-functional execution and implementation of those projects. We're looking for someone who has both an analytical mind-set and a collaborative problem-solving approach, who can solve complex problems in a structured manner, and is comfortable working in an ambiguous and evolving role.


Your Responsibilities

Drive and support cross-functional initiatives such as quarterly company-wide planning, pricing strategy, strategic investments and geographic expansion

Partner with stakeholders across Loom to support their business initiatives and operations in a collaborative, data-driven way

Work cross-functionally to engage with project partners to understand, scope and implement operational improvements or perform analysis to inform strategic decision-making

Leverage your business background to design and implement strong systems and processes that support Loom's scaling and improves Loom's operational performance

Exercise sound business judgment to prioritize and evaluate new initiatives and company priorities, with an eye toward long term value creation


What We're Looking For

5+ years of relevant experience in management consulting, investment banking, private equity, corporate planning, business finance, analytics, or related fields.

Practical business sense and a strong ability to ask the right questions and translate strategic concepts into an operational execution plan

A highly entrepreneurial “roll up your sleeves” mindset; excited about making an impact at a fast-growing company

Strong analytical and problem-solving skills; ability to distill complex issues into structured frameworks and communicate actionable insights.

Excellent ability to communicate effectively with all levels of the organization and build strong working relationships

Experience with SQL or strong willingness to learn


How We Work

Freedom and Flexibility: 
At Loom, we believe work is an act, not a place. When we disengage work from a location, we can accommodate a broad range of life choices. You can choose to work from home or while you travel. If you are in the Bay Area, you can drop by our San Francisco office on 2nd and Market St. when reopens in Fall 2021. We are able to hire across the United States and Canada* and are continuing to expand our international presence. And you are free to move within a country without any adjustment to compensation.

Engaging Workday:
 The key to an engaging workday is finding the right balance between different ways to work sync, async, text and video. Loom makes it easier for us to say what we mean without having to schedule a zoom meeting or struggle to find the right words. And using async communication allows us to free up time for deep work every day. We believe there's a place for sync time - often a conversation on Zoom is exactly what is needed. For team meetings, this ‘sync time’ is typically between 9AM-Noon PT given where the overlap of timezones where Loommates are located.

Work-Rest Balance: 
The way we balance the fast-paced demands of a high-growth startup and sustainability is making rest a priority. We offer a flexible PTO policy so you're able to take time off when you need it. We also go fully offline once a year between Christmas and New Year (and twice during the Pandemic). Rest is also part of the workday, not just during PTO. Taking a break for personal commitments, whether it's watching the kids or getting some exercise is natural part of the workday.

Social Connection: 
Relationships and connectedness matter. We are intentional about building trust and relationships through unique, shared experiences. Our virtual workspace keeps us connected day-to-day whether it's through Looms celebrating wins or our buzzing Slack communities. Post-COVID, we want Loommates to meet in person at least twice a year purely for fun. We're also experimenting in local offices as social spaces, starting with San Francisco in Fall 2021.

Instacart is the North American leader in online grocery and one of the fastest-growing companies in e-commerce. Since 2012, we've been working towards creating a world where everyone has access to the food they love and more time to enjoy it together.



Groceries delivered to your door in as little as an hour. It seems simple, right? Well, it's more complex than that. From re-routing deliveries during snowstorms, to connecting customers with coupons and deals for their favorite brands, to updating over half a billion grocery data lines every night...our efforts bring Instacart closer to being the operating system for the grocery industry.



Solving these problems is what helps our customers get back time in their day, so they can do more of what they love.

Company Summary

Annexon Biosciences is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a pipeline of novel therapies for patients with classical complement-mediated disorders of the body, brain and eye.

The Company’s second product candidate, ANX007, is a monoclonal antibody antigen-binding fragment (Fab) formulated for intravitreal administration for the treatment of neurodegenerative ophthalmic disorders. Based on learnings from its initial trials, Annexon is advancing its current programs while evaluating additional orphan and large market indications.

Founded in 2014, Opendoor’s mission is to empower everyone with the freedom to move. We believe the traditional real estate process is broken and our goal is simple: build a digital, end-to-end customer experience that makes buying and selling a home simple, certain and fast. We have assembled a dedicated team with diverse backgrounds to support more than 100,000 homes bought and sold with us and the customers who have selected Opendoor as a trusted partner in handling one of their largest financial transactions. But the work is far from over as we continue to grow in new markets. Transforming the real estate industry takes tenacity and dedication. It takes problem solvers and builders. It takes a tight knit community of teammates doing the best work of their lives, pushing one another to transform a complicated process into a simple one. So where do you fit in? Whether you’re passionate about real estate, people, numbers, words, code, or strategy - we have a place for you. Real estate is broken. Come help us fix it.




About the team

In the past five years, Opendoor has expanded rapidly to 30 cities and buys and sells billions of dollars of homes per year. But, our vision is to empower everyone with “the freedom to move”, which necessitates making the Opendoor experience more affordable, consistent, and customer friendly in existing markets, while we also expand our coverage into new markets.

The Operations Excellence team is responsible for driving many of Opendoor’s most complex and cross-functional priorities from inception to scale. We use technology and process improvement to refine a very complex operating model that powers “the freedom to move”. Our scope starts with the minute a home seller receives an offer from Opendoor, ends with our reselling each home we buy to the next customer, and touches hundreds of processes in between from inspecting each home before we buy it, to renovating homes we own, to negotiating contract terms with buyers. We make both linear and step change improvements to continue to elevate how we serve customers across all of our existing markets, and expand our core platform and adjacent products (e.g., Buy with Opendoor, Mortgage) to additional markets.

Our core team of ~25 professionals supports an org of over 1,000 people (and growing!) We combine biz ops, product ops, launch and analytics and engage with a wide range of teams across the company, but define ourselves by our mission and the results we achieve, not functionally.


As a Senior Manager you will:

Manage strategic projects to improve our operations with a high degree of judgment and autonomy. 
You’ll truly own initiatives end-to-end from creating clarity around ambiguous problems, including difficult tradeoffs, to leading cross-functional teams to execute your recommendation and shepherding meaningful change across the organization.

Drive organization’s thinking on operational strategy: 
You will continuously challenge the status quo of how we operate, and recognize that “what got us here, won’t get us there”. The output of this thinking will be helping to shape the company’s roadmap for foundational process and new business opportunity in 6-12 month increments

Connect and advocate for teams across the company:
 You’ll be a key point of contact between leaders in our Market Operations (Regional General Managers), CX, and EPD (Engineering, Product, Design) teams located in cities across the country. Your role will be highly collaborative: you’ll work across our functions to make sure the needs of each team are surfaced and heard at the executive level. You’ll frequently be the conduit between engineering and product teams and teams leading home renovations in the field, and need to be at ease working with both.

 
Provide decision making support and thought leadership to the Operations leadership team. 
You will use both qualitative and quantitative data to drive insights - the “what”, and most importantly the “so what” to help ensure that our organization is moving in the right direction and considering the right tradeoffs as we scale.

Lead change across Operations Orgs
: As a company, we’re moving fast, and recognize that we need to constantly iterate to make our operations as smooth and efficient as they can be. You will be at the forefront of change management that includes changes in our tech tools, changes in our processes, or changes in our organizational structure. We recognize that each of those changes can impact the day-to-day of many people in the division, and you’ll be responsible not only for rolling out these changes, but also ensure their adoption by the org


We're looking for teammates who are:

Both a systems thinker and a “doer”: 
you’re a strategic thinker who can go deep on a business and understand its core drivers; you’re also biased to action and know that the true test of an idea comes when we try it out in the real world.

Quantitative and data driven: 
you’re eager and able to drive insights to the business using data. You’re experienced in designing analyses to prove or disprove hypotheses, and you look to data not only for the “what” (“what’s happening in our business?”) but the “so what” (“why does this matter and what is it telling us about potential next steps?”). Equally important: you understand that “data” doesn’t always exist in a spreadsheet, and you’re excited to talk to customers and get on the ground to understand how different markets work.

A creative problem solver: 
You have a proven track record of thinking “outside the box” to solve complicated and multi-faceted problems. You think top-down, bottoms-up and from multiple angles to make sure we’re being exhaustive in the way we evaluate our business.

Highly collaborative: 
You’re excited about working across all of our regions and across all levels of the organization: with our leadership team, our functions, our GMs, and our city operations teams. You’re a strong communicator with the ability to motivate and inspire cross-functional teams.

Customer-first: 
You care about our customers, and you understand that we exist, first and foremost, to serve a customer need. Selling a home is stressful and emotional, affecting our customers’ largest asset. You’re mindful of that in everything that you and the team do.

Hungry and energetic: 
You’re determined to hit ambitious goals and can rally a team and our organization behind them. You are not above or below any task. You want to build momentum for your initiatives and the team, and are excited about building a generational company the disrupts one of the world’s largest industries

A leader: 
you can inspire confidence in cross-functionalteams or the organization as a whole, and establish followership to drive your initiatives forward.

What Makes Cloudflare Special?



We're not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We're a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.



Project Galileo
: We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare's enterprise customers-at no cost.



Athenian Project
: We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.



Path Forward Partnership
: Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.



1.1.1.1
: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here's the deal - we don't store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.

It's a multi-billion dollar space typically dominated by service-oriented vendors, and we're coming at it with cutting-edge technology and elegant design. It's working, and we've been growing very rapidly: we host hundreds of terabytes of data and work with all 50 state Attorneys General and hundreds of law firms on some of the most high-profile cases litigated today.

If you’re looking for an open and vibrant company culture that values passion, integrity, and a desire to learn, we want to hear from you.

About the job

A problem isn’t truly solved until it’s solved for all. That’s why Googlers build products that help create opportunities for everyone, whether down the street or across the globe. As a Technical Program Manager at Google, you’ll use your technical expertise to lead complex, multi-disciplinary projects from start to finish. You’ll work with stakeholders to plan requirements, identify risks, manage project schedules, and communicate clearly with cross-functional partners across the company. You're equally comfortable explaining your team's analyses and recommendations to executives as you are discussing the technical tradeoffs in product development with engineers.



Our goal is to build a Google that looks like the world around us — and we want Googlers to stay and grow when they join us. As part of our efforts to build a Google for everyone, we build diversity, equity, and inclusion into our work and we aim to cultivate a sense of belonging throughout the company.



The Engineering Field Services team plans, deploys, and maintains the hardware components of Google's Compute, Storage and Network Infrastructure in various locations in the most efficient, reliable, secure and scalable way possible. The Business Continuity Service Desk will provide support to the third-party data center organization and ensure that leadership is provided with timely and accurate information. In this role, you will also have the opportunity to work in the capacity of an Account Manager. You will act as advisor and advocate for internal customers for services deployed in non-Google owned data centers.


Behind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technical Infrastructure team to keep it running. From developing and maintaining our data centers to building the next generation of Google platforms, we make Google's product portfolio possible. We're proud to be our engineers' engineers and love voiding warranties by taking things apart so we can rebuild them. We keep our networks up and running, ensuring our users have the best and fastest experience possible.

Responsibilities


Enable thoughtful scaling of process, systems and analytics capabilities to support all of third-party data centers.


Work with cross-functional teams to capture data needs, and develop data visualizations for leadership.

Establish and maintain a position as an advisor and advocate for internal customers for services deployed in non-Google owned data centers.


Work with customer technical leads, executives, and partners to manage and deliver infrastructure solutions.


Become a trusted expert in data center infrastructure solutions, and provide effective operational and technical advice around these technologies.


Google is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace and is an affirmative action employer.

Healthy oceans are the lifeblood of our planet. But they're in peril - from climate change, overfishing, habitat destruction and other threats.

One of the greatest threats to the oceans is overfishing, which is why our dedicated team of scientists, economists and fishery management experts are collaborating with partners around the globe to make sustainable fishing the norm. Through our programs in the U.S., Latin America and Asia Pacific, we draw on strong science and economic principles to advance sustainable fishing practices, forward-looking policies and innovative tools that support the health of our oceans and the people who depend on them for food and their livelihoods.

Tile’s Mission

We solve real problems with technology to make people’s daily lives better.

At Tile, we recognize that daily life is challenging. We lead busy lives filled with family, friends, jobs, pets, and other things we love. Balancing this can be demanding, unpredictable and stressful.

We use technology to solve real everyday problems that keep each day running smoothly. People rely on Tile to be a seamless part of their lives whether they are at home or out in the world.

By helping to make daily lives easier, we free people to find their best lives — whatever that means to them. Tile is for everyone, on every platform, everywhere in the world. Tile for life.

About Tile

Tile is best known today for its market-leading Bluetooth finders with over 35 million units sold and ~5M items located daily. That said, Tile has recently expanded the devices that are findable by its platform by embedding its software into third-party products.

Over 30 billion Bluetooth devices are shipping over the next 5 years and each of these can be Tile-enabled with a software update. Partnerships have been announced with HP for laptops, leading audio headset OEMs like Bose and SkullCandy, and several others. Tile also has a large portfolio of unannounced OEM partnerships with top brands in many other large verticals (e.g. wearables, bikes, etc.) and is integrating its technology on the Bluetooth chips to make the Tile enablement more seamless for these partners (e.g. Tile has a partnership with Intel for PCs).

In addition to the OEM and chip partnerships, Tile is scaling its finding network by entering into access point partnerships with companies like Google, Amazon, and Comcast (all announced and ongoing).

From a business model perspective, Tile is shifting the relationship with its customers from a transactional device sale to offering a long-term, high-value service. Tile introduced its premium service two years ago and has ~400K subscribers today with a specific focus on growing annual recurring revenue.

We are guided by our company values, which are 
Start with Trust
, 
Bring It
,
 Build What Matters
, 
Better Together
, and 
Power What’s Next
. Recently accredited as a Great Place to Work, we are a high-performing team and our leaders consider themselves to be performance coaches with a primary responsibility of accelerating Tile’s success and that of their teammates.

On the off chance you've thought about insurance, it's likely because you've insured something you love, not because you loved your insurance company. Metromile is out to change that. As an insurtech powered by data science and customer-centric design, we're building a community of drivers who come for the savings and stay for the experience.



With technology at its core, Metromile is reimagining insurance to make it fairer and actually delightful. We're obsessed with savings, service, and features - street sweeping alerts, monthly mileage summaries, fuel trackers and more - that engage a customer all along their journey. We're on the forefront of disrupting a $250 billion auto insurance category that has gone unchanged for over 80 years.



Metromile's diverse team combines the best of Silicon Valley technologists with veterans from Fortune 500 insurers and financial services giants. This management structure ensures that the business is focused on growth, customer experience and technology innovation while also balancing unit economics and profitability. Our team is growing quickly across the country. We have offices in SF, Tempe and Boston and welcome remote workers across the country. Our customer experience, claims, and sales teams are all based in-house in the US.



Thanks to what makes us different - our people and our technology - we've been honored with a slew of awards. A few recent ones include: named a Benzinga ""Best Insuretech"" finalist, a 
Top Company to Work For
, one of the 
Healthiest Employers in Phoenix
, and a 
Best Place to Work
. And, our CEO was recognized as a 2020 
40 under 40
.

About the Role

You will serve as a critical member of LendingClub’s fast-growing Auto finance business, responsible for building out our core operational reporting and analytical capabilities, developing our servicing policies, and managing our key investor and loan servicing partner relationships. You’ll monitor and drive operational performance to ensure both high customer satisfaction for borrowers and strong collections performance for investors, while maintaining the highest regulatory compliance standards. In addition to owning collection efficiency, portfolio delinquency and charge-off responsibilities, as an early member of a small team, you will be empowered (and expected) to lead cross-functional projects that drive improved performance and help us scale as we grow.

What You'll Do

Drive accountability of LendingClub’s servicing partners through ongoing performance monitoring, including regular reviews of customer satisfaction, compliance, collections activity and effectiveness, and portfolio delinquency and loss trends

Develop core policies that govern our servicing, collections, and loss recovery functions

Develop strong analytics and reporting to support accountability and insights across the auto business

Develop data-driven collections strategies and scoring in partnership with servicing partners

Work closely with Product, Risk and other cross-functional teams on initiatives that improve the customer experience and supports investor needs

Negotiate contracts with key vendors and work closely with compliance and vendor management teams to drive due diligence and ongoing audits

Some travel may be required; not a significant aspect of the role

About You

4+ years of experience in a highly analytical and data-driven role in an entrepreneurial setting

Excellent proficiency in Excel and SQL, or other query languages (ability to self-service data needs is a must!); Tableau experience a strong plus

Financial services and lending operations experience strongly preferred; working knowledge of loan servicing, collections, portfolio loss and asset-backed securitizations a strong plus

Bachelor’s Degree in a quantitative field from a top undergraduate institution

Snowflake’s founders started from scratch and designed a data platform built for the cloud that is effective, affordable, and accessible to all data users. But it didn’t stop there. They engineered Snowflake to power the Data Cloud, where thousands of organizations unlock the value of their data with near-unlimited scale, concurrency, and performance. This is our vision: a world with endless insights to tackle the challenges and opportunities of today and reveal the possibilities of tomorrow.

Our Sales Strategy and Planning team is seeking a Pricing Operations Lead to join our growing team. The pricing strategy team manages Snowflake’s pricing and business models to maximize Snowflake’s long term profitability and growth. In this role, you will help set policies, drive operational efficiency, and manage business processes critical to the Strategic Pricing function. You will work with functional leaders across Sales, Product, Finance, Legal, and IT organizations to build and improve our systems and processes related to price setting, pricing book management, pricing enablement, and business control.



What you bring: You love tinkering and improving things, and see operational inefficiencies as an opportunity to roll up your sleeves and innovate. You like to “think big” - the idea of scaling 10x or 100x doesn’t faze you. You are a “full stack” player; comfortable in lead or support roles across a variety of projects and responsibilities. You have a passion for technology and the role it plays in market, industry and company change. As a builder at heart, you have an appreciation for operational excellence and what it takes to build a world-class software company that operates at a global scale




IN THIS ROLE YOU WILL GET TO:


Manage pricing approval process and workflow, including all business control / compliance processes, policy documents and approval evidence for internal audits / compliance review


Work with cross-functional business partners and leadership to design and improve business processes, data model, and business systems to manage Snowflake’s global price lists


Manage the pricing list change control and validation process


Document and manage business policies related to price setting, pricing approval, foreign currency price list (FX) adjustment


Create and manage internal and external facing pricing artifacts and enablement contents, deliver training and enablement materials


Proactively identify gaps in systems and processes that will become major roadblocks as the company scales. Recommend new projects and initiatives to tackle those gaps


ON DAY ONE WE WILL EXPECT YOU TO HAVE:


5+ years of professional experience with a core focus in pricing, sales and/or product operations; experience in high growth B2B Software, Platform and/or IaaS environments is highly preferred


Prior experience in management consulting with experience in business operations, growth / pricing strategy, or business control compliance / auditing is a plus


Experience with building and maintaining business control process and designing business approval workflow


Working knowledge of relevant business control regulations such as Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX), and other business processes and systems related to pricing management, quote-to-cash, principles of revenue recognition, etc.


Experience partnering with key internal functions to drive projects to completion; particularly Finance, Compliance, Legal, and IT.


Experience working with SQL, relational data and common BI tools a plus, but not required


Extremely organized and detail oriented, ability to balance time and effort across multiple projects


Bachelor degree required, MBA preferred




Snowflake is growing fast, and we’re scaling our team to help enable and accelerate our growth. We are looking for people who share our values, challenge ordinary thinking, and push the pace of innovation while building a future for themselves and Snowflake.

Familiarity with business and sales systems


Familiarity with BI tools



Wifi is the foundation of the modern home. Without it, nothing works. eero, an Amazon company, is the first company to deliver a whole home WiFi experience using mesh technology, ensuring there isn’t a home layout or connected device we can’t handle. Fixing connectivity is, however, just the start. We’re working on the building blocks of the smart home by designing our own hardware, enabling it with powerful software, and tying it all together to the cloud. A home that anticipates our needs, takes care of us and our families, keeps us safe and healthy, and saves money and energy.


Overview of role


Business Operations is a new and critical function at eero, reporting to the Head of Business Operations. This role will work closely with the Sales, Finance, Manufacturing, and Operations teams to develop robust operational processes and data-informed analyses, ultimately supporting successful business growth, operational efficiency, and sales acceleration. This is a highly visible role in which you will have a high degree of autonomy, and outsized impact.



We’re looking for someone who:




Is highly analytical and process-driven, can assist with strategic planning, drive decisions forward, execute on high-impact projects, and lead through influence.


Understands numbers intuitively: if the numbers don’t add up, you spot it first. If you find yourself or others repeating work, you automate it.


Demonstrates ability to think strategically and analytically about business, product, and operational challenges.


Has experience managing stakeholders at all levels.


Enjoys rolling up their sleeves in a fast paced startup environment and getting things done.


Is able to work cross-functionally with many teams and multi-tasks with a sense of urgency.


Has an uncanny ability to embrace ambiguity and see around the corners.


Has impeccable attention to detail, follow-through, and resourcefulness.




What you will do:




Build efficient processes and implement new systems: you will spot the highest priority business initiatives and improvement areas, and devise new processes or implement new systems to bring those to life.


Lead or program manage multiple strategic initiatives at any given point. Some examples include: drafting business cases for a new market entry, influencing our pricing strategy, evaluating the impact of a new system integration opportunity, or strategizing to drive further monetization of a product line.


Drive weekly, monthly, and quarterly business reporting to leadership across eero and Amazon: you will be the hub for business data and communication, and act as the primary point of contact for sales, forecasting, and other business data for some of eero’s largest sales channels. When we over- or underperform in a given week, you’ll know why.


Assist with strategic planning: You will identify opportunities to influence, support, and execute on our strategy. You will assist with the quarterly and annual planning processes.


Collaborate and coordinate cross-functionally: you will need to navigate a complex organization split across eero, Amazon, and external partnerships. You will deeply understand the business dynamics of eero’s sales channels and recommend strategies that appropriately balance the needs of our various partners. As needed, you will gather and analyze data from multiple sources to inform decision-making at all levels.

About Tradeshift

Tradeshift is a unicorn in the fintech industry. We are disrupting a typically stagnant environment by connecting companies of all sizes and providing them with the platform and network needed to create value from old processes like procurement, invoicing, payments, and workflow. We recognize that business is both messy and social - two revelations that have driven the development of Tradeshift, a platform for all your business interactions. We work hard and our teams have great freedom and responsibility to choose the best solutions, technologies and approaches to evolve the product to the next level.

We believe that being a global, multicultural company is a tremendous strength and we have people working from 18 different countries with hubs in Bucharest, Copenhagen, Kuala Lumpur, and San Francisco. We believe that if we truly focus on how to work distributed and collaborate across locations and (home) offices, we will not only enjoy work more but also build better products for our customers, and ultimately be a better company.

Have you ever rented an apartment and wished the process could be better? At Funnel we do too. We know we need to make the process of renting an apartment as easy as purchasing socks on Amazon. We’ve created cloud-based marketing and leasing software that delivers the ultimate rental experience for everyone involved in the process. We’re in the process of transforming the real estate industry through cutting-edge technology built, sold, and supported by the most passionate people you’ll meet.

We’re searching for a Strategy & Operations Manager to lead the go-to-market approach to help us scale our core CRM business.

Get on-site with customers and non-customers to understand their business, how the pandemic has impacted them

Identify the core metrics that drive our client’s business that we have increased and work with our customer experience team to document those metrics for existing customers and new pilots.

Research how our management company clients are centralizing leasing operations and work with our product & customer experience team to identify a playbook to deliver centralization to new customers

Operate in a cross-functional environment, develop a strong relationship with product, customer experience and sales to ensure success of your priorities

What we think you’ll need:

5+ years of experience in consulting, strategy, biz dev, operations, technology, banking, analytics or related experience; high-growth or early-stage start-up experience is a plus

Proven track record of running initiatives, achieving goals, and succeeding in a team environment

You’ll really impress us if you have:

A JD or MBA

Experience in the real estate business

Experience with SQL

Harpoon Therapeutics is a clinical-stage immunotherapy company developing a novel class of T cell engagers that harness the power of the body’s immune system to treat patients suffering from cancer and other diseases. T cell engagers are engineered proteins that direct a patient’s own T cells to kill target cells that express specific proteins, or antigens, carried by the target cells. Using its proprietary Tri-specific T cell Activating Construct (TriTAC®) platform, Harpoon is developing a pipeline of novel TriTACs initially focused on the treatment of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. HPN424 targets PSMA and is in a Phase 1/2a trial for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. HPN536 targets mesothelin and is in a Phase 1/2a trial for cancers expressing mesothelin, initially focused on ovarian and pancreatic cancers. HPN217 targets BCMA and is in a Phase 1/2 trial for relapsed, refractory multiple myeloma. HPN328 targets DLL3 and is in a Phase 1/2 trial for small cell lung cancer and other DLL3-associated tumors. Harpoon has also developed a proprietary ProTriTAC™ platform, which applies a prodrug concept to its TriTAC platform to create a therapeutic T cell engager that remains inactive until it reaches the tumor.

About Freenome



Freenome is on a mission to empower everyone with the tools they need to detect, treat, and ultimately prevent cancer.



We have pioneered the most comprehensive multiomics platform for early cancer detection through a routine blood draw. By combining deep expertise in molecular biology with advanced computational biology and machine learning techniques to recognize disease-associated patterns among billions of circulating, cell-free biomarkers, we are developing simple and accurate blood tests for early cancer detection and integrating the actionable insights into health systems to operationalize a machine learning feedback loop between care and science.



Our recent $270 Million Series C brings our financing to over $500 million from investors, including; Bain Capital, Perceptive Advisors, RA Capital, Polaris Partners, Andreessen Horowitz, funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc., GV (formerly Google Ventures), Roche Venture Fund, Kaiser Permanente Ventures, American Cancer Society’s BrightEdge Ventures, Data Collective Venture Capital, Novartis and Verily Life Sciences.



Our Science



Freenome is building technology to advance the understanding of cancer through multiple analytes derived from blood. These signals include cell-free DNA, methylation of cell-free DNA, cell-free RNA, circulating proteins, and immune profiling derived from thousands of prospective samples. By developing novel statistical learning methods and applying them to integrate various -omics datasets, Freenome is a leader in modeling specific biological mechanisms to capture disease-dependent signatures, including gene expression, immune response, tumor burden, the tissue of origin, and 3D chromatin structure.



By building comprehensive discovery datasets and modeling critical biological systems, Freenome is learning what biological changes are present within the blood between a variety of different disease states, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, infections, drug response, and aging. The synthesis of Freenome’s datasets, cross-functional technical expertise, and audacious mission to discover biological truth, we seek to improve the lives of millions through early detection and early treatment of disease.

We believe in empowering and supporting each other in a collaborative and dynamic environment.

We are building the most compelling way to rent a car by committing to relentless customer centricity, technology-powered operational excellence, and capital efficiency. With our vision of 
giving people better access to fewer cars
, we saw record growth throughout COVID19, and are now doubling down on gaining market share with our recent raise of more than $9M in venture funding from some of the best investors in the industry (amongst others: investors in Auto 1, Bird, Lime, DoorDash, Flexport, and Slack).

At Kyte, we love what we do and we believe our diverse team of ridiculously ambitious individuals is what makes our company great. Together, we are mobility enthusiasts that have an assortment of wide-ranging backgrounds from Stanford, Berkeley, MIT, TUM, Uber, BMW, McKinsey, and others. We are headquartered in the sunny, San Francisco Marina district where we enjoy Bay views, good food, and a proper sound system for those late night working sessions. We have opened our second home strategically close to Oktoberfest in Munich, just 5 min from the Central Station in the beautiful district of Nymphenburg.

We offer competitive compensation, significant equity, and the ability to shape a big vision from early on. We are laser focused on bringing on talented individuals that are aligned with our vision and mission, to create a magical rental car experience from end to end. You will have more than significant ownership and impact on our company trajectory, and shape how people get around the cities they live in. We look forward to hearing from you!

About the role

We are excited to grow our supply team at Kyte and looking to bring on new team members. We’re seeking a highly motivated individual with a strong operational and start-up background that wants to disrupt the way people travel. The role is highly cross-functional, involving coordination across a number of groups within Kyte, including finance, supply, product, and operations. In other words, you will sit in the “control tower” and get exposure to all parts of the business. Successful candidates will have a passion for transportation/travel, exceptional analytical skills, bias toward action, exceptional organizational and communication skills. We move quickly as a team to drive company wide decisions, thus a balance getting the details right while still moving fast is important.

General Requirements

You like to take ownership when solving problems
: We believe in extreme ownership and look for people who will make decisions as if it were their own company.

Develop a strong and sustainable partnership network:
 Based on our strategy, it is your task to identify, benchmark and acquire service providers that best suit our vision. With your open and trusting personality, you will convince them to partner with and give their very best for us. Part of your responsibility is to analyze and evaluate offers as well as to negotiate contracts.

Problem solving
: Are you the kind of person who sees a problem and asks “why”? We are first and foremost a technology company, so you we want a data-driven mindset, strong business judgment, and proven ability to perform analysis, draw key insights, and form and execute a strategy.

Set up efficient and scalable processes:
 You support to shape the lifecycle of a vehicle from logistics over registration up to the return process. Together with suppliers and service providers, you implement efficient and highly scalable processes. You constantly monitor that the agreed service levels are met and lead times are reduced. If our partners do not perform in the desired way, it is your task to independently escalate and steer the cooperation into the right direction.

Support development of disruptive changes:
 You will develop and implement proprietary tools to orchestrate a complex network of suppliers and internal stakeholders in order to bring automation into a world mostly dominated by manual and repetitive processes and tasks.

Ambition
: Do you want to be a leader in an organization? You will be involved in the highest level leadership discussions and quickly become a leader - guaranteed.

Passion
 for Kyte, its role improving our access to transportation, and an interest in the platform methodology.

Curiosity: You’re the kind of person who wants to know how everything works. You love to learn new things every day.

Hustle: You go above and beyond and put the pedal to the metal to get things done with your results-driven attitude.

Data: You like to work analytically and make data-informed decisions.

Social: You have the ability to build relationships quickly with your outgoing and confident personality.

About Freenome



Freenome is on a mission to empower everyone with the tools they need to detect, treat, and ultimately prevent cancer.



We have pioneered the most comprehensive multiomics platform for early cancer detection through a routine blood draw. By combining deep expertise in molecular biology with advanced computational biology and machine learning techniques to recognize disease-associated patterns among billions of circulating, cell-free biomarkers, we are developing simple and accurate blood tests for early cancer detection and integrating the actionable insights into health systems to operationalize a machine learning feedback loop between care and science.



Our recent $270 Million Series C brings our financing to over $500 million from investors, including; Bain Capital, Perceptive Advisors, RA Capital, Polaris Partners, Andreessen Horowitz, funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc., GV (formerly Google Ventures), Roche Venture Fund, Kaiser Permanente Ventures, American Cancer Society's BrightEdge Ventures, Data Collective Venture Capital, Novartis and Verily Life Sciences.



Our Science



Freenome is building technology to advance the understanding of cancer through multiple analytes derived from blood. These signals include cell-free DNA, methylation of cell-free DNA, cell-free RNA, circulating proteins, and immune profiling derived from thousands of prospective samples. By developing novel statistical learning methods and applying them to integrate various -omics datasets, Freenome is a leader in modeling specific biological mechanisms to capture disease-dependent signatures, including gene expression, immune response, tumor burden, the tissue of origin, and 3D chromatin structure.



By building comprehensive discovery datasets and modeling critical biological systems, Freenome is learning what biological changes are present within the blood between a variety of different disease states, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, infections, drug response, and aging. The synthesis of Freenome's datasets, cross-functional technical expertise, and audacious mission to discover biological truth, we seek to improve the lives of millions through early detection and early treatment of disease.

The 100+ team members describe working at Nkarta through some of the following comments.

People are always open to ideas. This company provides a safe place for its employees (covid testing, etc.)

Exceptionally talented, committed, *kind* & supportive team

The CEO is transparent and honest with expectations for the whole company. There is genuine care amongst the leadership team for their peers and employees. I believe this is unique.

Not to sound corny, but the emphasis on people as a valuable resource is something I recognize doesn't often exist elsewhere, and it's here in ample supply, which is great.

It's the first place that I've worked where the executive team truly values the employees. It's a pretty amazing thing not to hear that employees can be replaced with someone new. Institutional knowledge is understood.

Job Description
The Operations Supervisor provides inspection services for our developer clients, homeowner associations and legal counsel. The Operations Supervisor provides supervision over the field inspectors as well as internal QA/QC of our inspections, processes, and safety procedures. The Operations Supervisor interacts with clients at the field and office level to ensure that we are meeting the needs of our clients (Customer Service). The Operations Supervisor manages special project services for clients as needed.
Duties and Responsibilities
The Operations Supervisor must be able to work independently, setting their own schedule while meeting the needs of our clients. The Operations Supervisor will be responsible for supervising all inspectors and inspections performed throughout the division.
Inspections are performed using the company’s custom database software (web-based) on a laptop or tablet. Field reports are automatically generated and emailed to the project site superintendent regarding relevant conditions of completed or the “in process” work of project subcontractors. Reports may also be reviewed by project managers, directors of construction, and legal counsel. On occasion, a special inspection may be performed and a field report may be prepared using a template in Adobe Acrobat, Microsoft Word or Excel.
Site inspections require the ability to view all the pertinent areas of buildings under construction. Inspections may require, but are not limited to, walking, climbing scaffolding and tall ladders, and the ability to access and inspect roof areas.
The Operations Supervisor must ensure that the inspectors are prepared and supported to allow them to work constructively and collaboratively with superintendents, trade workers, suppliers, manufacturers’ representatives, design professionals, and developer management to achieve the best possible field results.
The Operations Supervisor must be able to read, understand, and interpret architectural and engineering drawings and details of wood framed construction projects. The ability to review project drawings for missing or poor details of window installation, water intrusion, sound transmission, fire related issues, roof structures, and other high-risk areas is critical to the proper performance of the job.
The Operations Supervisor must be able to clearly communicate, in writing and verbally, with project team members and company management about relevant construction systems and processes.
The Operations Supervisor shall be knowledgeable of code requirements, regional trade practices, and manufacturers’ installation requirements for common materials. The inspector must be able to identify correct, or incorrect, installation methods in the field with special emphasis on the weather envelope. A clear understanding of the component products and installation of stucco, lath, windows, doors, decks/balconies, flashing, and roofs is essential.
The Operations Supervisor must be experienced at supervising and motivating others to success. The performance of others under the supervision of the Operations Supervisor will be reflected in the performance evaluation of the Operations Supervisor. The Operations Supervisor will be responsible for periodic review of each inspector’s completed inspections to ensure they meet the standards established by the company as well as the needs of our Client. The Operations Supervisor, with feedback from Clients, will identify areas of improvement needed for each inspector and, with the Executive Vice President, design and implement a training strategy for each as needed.
The Operations Supervisor will attend pre-construction meetings both internal and for projects as needed to ensure the Inspector can fully support the needs of the clients, both internal and external.
The Operations Supervisor will be required at times to review project RFIs and Submittals in relation with the plans, specifications, manufacturer requirements, warranty requirements, and industry standards. A formal written response is often required as well as periodic attendance at site meetings.

We believe that true innovation happens when everyone has room at the table and the tools, resources, and opportunity to excel.

Statement of Non-Discrimination: In keeping with our beliefs and goals, no employee or applicant will face discrimination or harassment based on: race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, age, gender, marital/domestic partner status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, disability status, or veteran status. Above and beyond discrimination and harassment based on ""protected categories,"" we also strive to prevent other subtler forms of inappropriate behavior (i.e., stereotyping) from ever gaining a foothold in our office. Whether blatant or hidden, barriers to success have no place at DoorDash. We value a diverse workforce – people who identify as women, non-binary or gender non-conforming, LGBTQIA+, American Indian or Native Alaskan, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, differently-abled, caretakers and parents, and veterans are strongly encouraged to apply. Thank you to the Level Playing Field Institute for this statement of non-discrimination.
