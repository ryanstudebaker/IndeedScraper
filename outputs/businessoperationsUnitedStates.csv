Who We are

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.)

Millions of people across the world come to Pinterest to find new ideas every day. It's where they get inspiration, dream about new possibilities and plan for what matters most. Our mission is to help those people find their inspiration and create a life they love. In your role, you'll be challenged to take on work that upholds this mission and pushes Pinterest forward. You'll grow as a person and leader in your field, all the while helping Pinners make their lives better in the positive corner of the internet.

Advertisers on Pinterest play a big role in providing the content that helps people discover and save the things they love. We’re looking for a motivated self-starter to establish strategy, execute operational improvements, and generate data driven insights for the Customer Success team. With the goal to help our global advertisers, big and small, get discovered by millions of people looking for things to plan, buy, and do. You’ll work directly with Customer Success leadership on improving our operational scale in the US and abroad. You’ll find data driven insights and make strategic recommendations to improve our operations and service, and work directly with our Global Sales and Services teams to help make Pinterest even better.

What you’ll do:

Advise leadership on ways to improve our operational strategy

Identify operational pain points; use data to size, prioritize and recommend at-scale strategic solutions

Mine data to find insights on the performance of the Customer Success team, our advertisers, and our sellers

Partner with cross functional teams, sales, service and product to facilitate successful conceptualization and execution of product and program launches

Recommend processes changes, systems, and workflow automation to improve the Pinterest services offered to advertisers

What we’re looking for:

Senior presence, ability to clearly and consistently work side-by-side across functions and departments synthesizing multiple points of view into a coherent action plan.

Ability to manage through ambiguous and subjective situations, including balancing strategic orientation and operational efficiency to ensure we deliver what is “right” for the customer.

Analytical and process-oriented, comfortable working with data and making data-driven decisions. Ability to think both creatively and critically, willing to think outside the box and challenge the status quo.

Skills needed: metrics creation, data manipulation & modeling (Excel, Tableau, SQL), understanding of how data is transferred, transformed and reported out (BI, Product Data tables & ETLs), able to leverage those data insights to build business cases and compelling strategic narratives.

Passion for Pinterest’s mission, supporting businesses and improving the users experience.

About the job

Google's leadership team hand-picks thorny business challenges, and members of BizOps work in small teams to find solutions. As part of this team you fully immerse yourself in data collection, draw insight from analysis, and then zoom out to develop compelling, synthesized recommendations. Taking strategy one step further, you also persuasively communicate your recommendations to senior-level executives, roll-up your sleeves to help drive implementation and check back-in to see the impact of your recommendations.


The Business Operations and Strategy team offers a working community with a focus on learning and development. As an Associate in Business Operations and Strategy, you will own the problem definition, analysis, work planning, and execution of your workstreams, and become the “expert” on key data/ topics. You will use storytelling skills to persuasively communicate your recommendations to executives, and influence decisions by building consensus, and mobilizing towards execution. Over time, you will build lasting relationships with colleagues across Alphabet, enabling you to execute rapidly with cross-functional support.


The Business Operations and Strategy team at Google plays a critical role in defining and driving strategic, operational and organizational improvements across the company. Also known as ""BizOps"", the group operates like an internal consulting group working on a range of critical projects and issues.

More about Mission Lane:



Mission Lane is based in the U.S., with offices in Richmond, Virginia & San Francisco, California. Founded in December 2018, we've rapidly grown to over 1 million customers.



It all started with a realization: nearly fifty percent of the adult population in the U.S. doesn't have access to a clear line of credit. And by ""clear"" we mean credit without crazy fees that only increase debt. Most traditional credit card companies either overlook or overcharge this group because they have less-than-prime credit scores or no score at all. We decided this just wouldn't do.



We understand that everyone doesn't have the same opportunities. We also know that everyone joins us at different stages of their financial journeys. Providing access to clear credit was a critical first step, but our work isn't done. We are actively developing new products designed to meet our customers where they are, according to their needs.



We get it - 
life happens
. That's why Mission Lane is hard at work paving a better way forward.



Just like for our customers, Mission Lane creates opportunities for our employees to learn, grow, and prosper. We strive to create an environment that brings out the best in everyone, everyday.

If you need assistance in obtaining a vaccine, the Company can help schedule you with one of its healthcare partners following a conditional job offer, if one is made. The Immigration Reform and Control Act requires that verification of employment eligibility be documented for all new employees by the end of the third day of work.

Get paid to be a boss and support humans in living their dream lives!
If it sounds like a dream come true to be a boss without… ya know, BEING the boss (aka entrepreneur taking on all the responsibilities)... while working from home in your yoga pants...Keep reading!
You’re probably in a place in your career where you’re feeling under-valued and not able to fully step into the potential and expertise that you have. You might be working for a large organization and feeling like a number, working for a business where you don’t align with the big vision they have (like what does selling paper clips have to do with helping the world?), or you’re trying to run your own business and feeling burnt out by having to wear so many freaking hats. Ahhh.
The life-changing work you thought you’d be doing when you started your career? Well… you’re wondering when you’re going to finally get to a place where you feel fulfilled and like you’re making a true difference with your specific experience and expertise. You’re lacking a real sense of purpose and passion in your day to day, and you know you were meant for more!
You know that people matter. You love working with people and supporting them towards big goals… managing brings you a ton of joy. It’s like coaching and supporting big potential for people, and you’re craving not only that responsibility in a career, but to see the impact that your managing and systems brain can do when it’s given the opportunity to thrive in the right job role (and company!)
Imagine being able to step up and manage a team of passionate humans where you’re all empowered to make big things happen inside the company and in your personal lives. A job where you have the autonomy and agency to lead projects, see your creative ideas come to life, and collaborate directly with the CEO to bring the big visions to life. What if your days were filled with this fulfilling work, where you can end each day closing your laptop knowing you made a big difference and have that sense of accomplishment?
You also know that running and growing your own business is not for you long term. That intra-preneur life is calling you! While you love the spirit of the entrepreneur, the daily stressors that come with this are something you're not wanting to take on. Making a solid paycheck and loving the work you do day in and day out sounds amazing!
At the Aligned Business™ we are all about supporting both our clients and our teams to literally live the life of their dreams. We are looking for a passionate Operations Manager to support the Aligned Business™ team as well as support us with the systems and operations to run the business in an organized and optimized way.
This is no ordinary management job, and we are not looking for an ordinary human! You know that people are the heart of any business and you’re ready to step up and support in a big way (While also living YOUR aligned life outside of work!) You’re excited to be a boss every day while getting paid to do what comes naturally to you — managing, optimizing processes, and organizing details.
About Pinegate Road & The Aligned Business™, and how you will be working within the business: 
You’re a detail-oriented people person with a passion for supporting (and managing) others. You love mentoring and leading others to live their best lives, and also work towards big goals together. Being the glue between the big ideas, and the details that make it all come to life feels especially exciting to you. Seeing how all the little details when done and managed in a unique way can come together to make BIG things happen (in life or business) brings you so much joy! You’re a go-getter that wants to see and feel the impact they are making on people and a growing business each and every day. You’re craving the ability to work in a company where you have the creative freedom to bring your ideas to the table, the agency to implement the ideas and manage the team to make them allllll happen.
You’re looking to work for a company that values you as a human being and helps create alignment between your life and career. Loving your day-to-day and doing meaningful work is important to you. Do you love systems, processes, and people? Are you excited about the idea of working for a company that empowers people to create a life of alignment and balance within their career and life - for their clients and team members?
You might be the perfect fit for this unique role in our company!
The Aligned Business, a coaching business by Kelsey Kerlsake of Pinegate Road, is hiring an Operations Manager to take over project management and people management, as well as work in tandem with Kelsey on the greater vision for the company's future. Students of the Aligned Business™ are online service providers, coaches, and consultants who want to scale their businesses and realize their vision for the future while not sacrificing their happiness and work-life blend. You will have the opportunity to work with and lead a team that loves what they do, is passionate about personal development, and feels a real sense of purpose in their day-to-day.

Small Batch Standard is the premier financial agency built to serve the craft brewing industry. Our team of consultants, accountants, tax specialists and industry experts are here to help breweries grow, profit, and thrive. We do this in order to build deep, successful relationships with the owners and operators who make this industry great.
*
We’re fully remote, with both team members and clients located all across the U.S. We’ve also made a commitment to running a Calm Company (https://basecamp.com/books/calm) that supports work-life integration. Here’s a short introduction to our firm: https://sbstandard.com/about/
*
The Role
We're looking for a full-time, remote Executive Assistant to join our specialized team. The main objective of this role is to provide leverage to the COO and CEO in accordance with the SBS Core Values.
DISCLAIMER: 
 Below you’ll find an outline of roughly the person we’re looking for, and roughly the responsibilities we’d like fulfilled by this position. But in truth, we’re not sure exactly what this role is going to look like long term, other than: we absolutely need this role long term, likely with more ownership and responsibility attached.
And so the individual who is the right fit for this role will not only need to be okay with some ambiguity and uncertainty as we figure out the exact scope of the role together, but will be excited by the opportunity: to apply your experience, determination, and creativity towards building out a new role that both creates leverage for our executive team and helps us fulfill our mission as a company.
Our Values
How we work is just as important as the results that we deliver. Everything that we do, day-in and day-out, is guided by our core values and is embodied in our team, our process, and our relationships with clients, partners, and the industry. Our core values are:
Antifragile
Play The Long Game
Embrace Technology
Build and Trust The Process
Operate With The Client’s Best Interest In Mind
Far from your typical corporate “values” checklist, we hire, evaluate, and make our most important strategic decisions against these criteria. The right fit for this role will embrace, uphold, and contribute to forwarding these values in the work they do, and the interaction they have with clients and team members.
The Person
We’re looking for an individual who:
Has experience working (and thriving) as an executive assistant
 for a C-suite level individual or team: navigating, organizing, facilitating, and gate-keeping the highest level of strategic, mission-critical, and confidential information within the business. (And calmly handling the “personalities” that often come along for the ride.)
Is deeply versed and draws energy from the People aspect of the work.
 You’re excited by and highly competent in facilitating the hiring process, interacting with team members and clients, and coordinating communication across the company.
Is an expert in all things involved in rock-solid execution.
 You take pride in being that one person in the company about whom everyone wonders, “How is it even humanly possible to be this on point all the time?” Scheduling, agendas, logistics, inboxes, tasks, follow ups… all of the work that needs to happen in and around “the work” is what you’re best at.
Is a technology savant.
 It is one of our core values, and in this role it will be at the forefront of your work. You’ll need to come to the table with the highest level of technology usage proficiency and adaptability in the company. Developers may know how to build it, but you know how to truly USE it.
The Work
This role will report to the COO and is accountable for fulfilling the following responsibilities:
Run our executive logistics.
 This means owning (to various degrees) calendars and inboxes and acting as an attention buffer. Protecting blocks of time and re-organizing meetings and other responsibilities accordingly. Scheduling and organizing team and client meetings. Looking ahead to coordinate preparation for upcoming meetings and deliverables, recording details, and organizing follow ups. The ultimate goal here is to act as a filter and lever for requests, information, and key details so that our executive team can spend longer periods of time away from communication to facilitate focus and progress on mission-critical objectives.
Own our hiring process logistics.
 Everything we need to support our recruiting efforts and hiring decisions. This includes things like: editing and posting job descriptions, managing job posts, filtering applications, scheduling screening calls and follow up interviews, collecting references and scheduling reference calls, generating job offer documentation, setting up start dates and kicking off the new employee onboarding process.
Coordinate new employee onboarding.
 Everything we need to welcome new employees into the team, and enable and support them as they get up to speed. This includes things like: setting up user accounts, sending setup emails, sending books and shirts, coordinating payroll setup, creating onboarding documents, scheduling onboarding and training meetings, making sure templates and SOPs are up to date, coordinating training details with the team.
Own your scorecard and rock projects.
 We run our business on EOS and Shape Up and use those frameworks to set monthly objectives (the Scorecard) and longer-term strategic projects (the Rocks) both at the team and individual level in order to make progress towards the firm’s annual goals and overall vision. You’ll be responsible for ensuring you’re meeting your targets and completing projects.
Participate and contribute to the overall success of our team.
 Each week the team meets (both over Zoom and asynchronously) to share wins, progress, and knowledge, as well as identify and solve issues. This occurs at multiple levels: as a company, as an operations team, and individually both with your manager and peers. Your full participation in this process is critical in order to problem solve, develop both individual and group knowledge and skill, and ensure that we are operating as a cohesive unit to achieve our ultimate mission.
Participate in ongoing process improvement.
 Each week we work not only to serve our clients, but also to improve the process of how we conduct that work. Every member of our team is expected to be on the lookout and vocal about issues, inefficiencies, and opportunities for improvement. You’ll work both internally and with clients to contribute to that ethic and continuously improve our processes.
The Requirements
In order for this role to operate effectively, the following requirements must be met:
Previous experience as an Executive Assistant to a C-suite team or individual in a remote environment.
Have a demonstrated ability to handle confidential information and use discretion in communicating potentially sensitive information with clients, team members, and the company’s broader network.
Have crystal clear professional written and verbal communication skills with the ability to work with clients, partners, vendors, and internal team members alike.
Have exacting organizational standards and a calm and friendly, yet persistent follow-up focus in order to ensure things get done on time.
Have a demonstrated ability to rapidly adapt to new technologies and software, as well as learn independently as needs come up.
Have rock solid proficiency with the full Google Suite of products.
Available and responsive during normal business hours (9am-5pm Eastern Time, Monday-Friday).
Have a strong, consistent internet connection and a work environment conducive to video calls.
Preferred, but not required qualifications include:
Previous HR and/or recruiting experience, either as an employee within this function or as an assistant to this process.
Previous sales and/or customer service experience directly interacting with clients or customers.
Experience and/or knowledge of the craft brewing industry and brewing process.
Experience with inbox delegation and management within Front.
Experience with Google Workspace administration.
Experience using Podio or similar remote project management tools (e.g. Trello, Asana, Wrike, Smartsheet, etc.).
Experience with Wordpress (in particular, content management and Gravity Forms).
Experience using Zapier to set up business automations.
Beyond the basics, the individual best fit for this role will need to be consistently motivated, engaged, curious, and able to exemplify the core values of the firm, while executing the objectives of the position with speed, precision, and expertise.

At Citadel, our mission is to make verifications easy for everyone.


We think it's crazy that it can take 5 to 7 days to verify someone's employment or income. Alternatives are even worse, an API call should 
not
 cost $40.


When Citadel succeeds, we'll save billions of dollars for companies and billions of hours for people who're still filling out forms and uploading paystubs.


Imagine applying for a loan or verifying your job history with a click of a button. That's what Citadel is empowering.

We like to nerd out about using the cutting-edge tech and building frictionless user experiences. We love crafting great products and see our users delighted by what we build.


We're a distributed team with no plans to start an office anytime soon. We don't really care where you are, but we care a lot about who you are. If you like solving business problems with data, helping your team members excel at what they do, being part of a community, and care about quality, you'll fit in.


You would be an early hire on our Operations team and work on a variety projects as a generalist.


The Problems you'll solve and what you will do:


Support our Operations Team with a variety of tasks including customer support, sales development, and admin support tasks.


Run processes reliably and efficiently.


Help improve our internal processes to grow Citadel fast and make our customers happy.


Work with different teams across the company to improve business performance and efficiency

Our mission is to accelerate the adoption of cryptocurrency so that you and the rest of the world can achieve financial freedom and inclusion. In our first decade, Kraken has risen to become one of the largest, most successful and respected crypto exchanges on the planet.

We are changing the way the world thinks about finance and our range of successful products are playing a critical role in the mainstream adoption of crypto assets. We continue to trail-blaze into new territory with the introduction of Kraken Bank, providing a more seamless integration between crypto and the traditional financial system. This makes us the first crypto company (ever) to be awarded a U.S. state banking charter.

Our diverse group of 2,000+ Krakenites are distributed all over the world as part of our 'remote first' culture, united by a shared passion for delighting customers, upholding crypto values and achieving our meaningful mission. We attract people who push themselves to improve, are radically transparent and think differently in order to unlock their potential.

Crypto is a rapidly evolving industry and we’re just getting started. We’re growing fast and you're invited to join the revolution!

Role

You will be responsible for building and operationalizing world class hiring infrastructure across our organization, delivering a ‘0 to 1’ transformation that will enable Kraken to scale rapidly and at quality.

This role will suit an organizer of chaos who is obsessed with detail and consistency, yet can balance the needs of an evolving business to ensure we achieve incremental, continuous improvement through iteration. We believe Recruiting is a product which must be well designed to delight our customers, taking an Agile approach to ensuring we achieve this. We make hiring easy to understand to unlock the potential of all Krakenites to contribute as part of an ecosystem, with modern frameworks and deep partnerships underpinning everything.

Impact

Over the next two years, you can expect to have achieved the following:

Built a world-class, modern RecOps function from scratch to become the circulatory system for hiring
Made it possible for the business to more than double in size from our current 2,000 Krakenites
Led major, cross-functional transformation projects to level-up the hiring ecosystem
Implemented industry leading assessment techniques and best practices at scale for a remote-first company
Introduced an interconnected suite of ‘best in class’ systems and tools, creating hyper efficiency and efficacy
Developed seamless analytics and reporting, allowing data driven insight to flow freely around the organisation
Designed a plethora of fundamental, low-friction processes with an emphasis on automation
Architected an enviable standard and support for candidate experience which follows the sun for business continuity

This list is not exhaustive.


Competencies

Substantial recruitment experience within a reputable fast-growing technology/product business against ruthless competition

Impactful experience as a strategic and operational leader of hiring teams, preferably Recruiting Operations

A project managers mindset, ideally with competent knowledge and application of delivery frameworks and methodologies such as Agile

Steadfast organizer of chaos, able to prioritise and deploy resources for maximum effectiveness

Champion of data-driven insights balanced with an instinct for improvement

Deep appreciation and respect for the fundamentals of talent acquisition, but creative, curious and innovative when considering modern tactics

Influential and convincing communicator with compelling business partnership/stakeholder management skills

Empathetic, emotionally intelligent, motivated and passionate

Highly resilient, relentless and cheerful in the face of adversity

Doing this requires a rapidly growing team of amazing, curious, empathetic people with a wide range of skill sets-spanning technology, data science, product, marketing, sales, service, claims handling, finance, etc.


Now is the perfect time to join the journey. Here's why:


It's working. We're now in ten states and on our way to operating countrywide. We have thousands of agents selling our product and millions of dollars of annual customer premiums.

We're well-backed & stable. We closed our $40M Series B fundraise in December and have years of cash runway in the bank. We're backed by some of the top investors in the world-including Google's “Gradient (https://www.gradient.com/)” AI-focused fund, Obvious Ventures (https://obvious.com/) (Beyond Meat, etc.), and Advance Venture Partners (https://www.avp.vc/).

It's not too late! Despite this traction and stability, we're still early enough in the journey that there's time to make a real difference during Openly's formative period.


If you'd like to understand more about Openly's mission, consider checking out this video (https://vimeo.com/267654520) from a company pitch we gave several years ago at Techstars. It's outdated (before the initial product launch) but still telegraphs the journey we're on.

Retool has been growing at breakneck speed these past few years. We need to build the processes and structures for Retool to continue to grow and operate at scale in the next decade and beyond. Business Operations (BizOps) serves as the connective tissue to help Retool operate better.

As one of the first members of the BizOps team, you’ll help us make pivotal decisions about the Retool business—from how we allocate resources to how we price our products, to what opportunities we should pursue next. We’re a fast-paced startup with new challenges to tackle every week. You’ll be wearing many different hats as you take on whatever is needed to help the business succeed.

WHAT YOU'LL DO

By design, BizOps responsibilities and projects will evolve with the needs of Retool. We’ll look to you to understand our biggest areas of opportunity, create a plan, and execute with multiple cross-functional stakeholders. You’ll leverage your past experience to accelerate our growth and plugging in where the business needs you most. Some weeks you’ll focus on more strategic projects, and other weeks you’ll be in the weeds.

For example, you’d:
Help identify Retool’s main priorities and core metrics
Define a go-to-market strategy for the company for the next 12-24 months to accelerate our growth
Incubate and help run new teams
Define new product opportunities
Define our strategy to grow Retool in international markets
Come up with a customer segmentation to organize our GTM/customer facing teams
Design and run new processes that improve our operations (e.g. OKRs or business reviews)

WHO YOU'LL WORK WITH

This is a highly cross-functional role, and you’ll partner with all of Retool’s teams to do what it takes to get the work done. You will work closely with various functional leads, and their teams, on various strategy and operations projects.

You might work with Finance, Customer Support, and Customer Success on one project, then with Sales, Marketing, and Engineering on the following one. Either way, you’ll have an impact on all teams in all parts of the business.


THE SKILLSET YOU'LL BRING:

2-4 years of relevant experience in management consulting, investment banking, private equity, Business Operations, or operating at a high growth tech company

A proven track record of running complex, cross-functional, and operational projects, preferably in a high growth environment, from inception to launch

A highly entrepreneurial mindset and a knack for spotting new opportunities for growth

A capacity to go deep into different functional areas, without losing the big picture

A low ego and an aptitude to work with different personality types. You are not afraid of getting your hands dirty!

Curiosity to work on new topics and different areas of the company as needed, whether it’s figuring out how to incubate a new function, or running our OKRs process

Strong spreadsheet modeling experience

Excellent presentation and writing skills and the ability to clearly communicate messages that link business issues, financial results, and strategy at the executive level

Experience with SQL or a willingness to learn

Passion for technology products and SaaS businesses

Therefore, we are seeking a talented administrator and personnel manager to permanently join our practice in the “multi-hatted” role of Business Operations and Personnel Manager. 
Let’s begin with an Introduction!
Perio Atlanta is the practice of Dr. Langston and Dr. Kashlan whose specialty is Periodontics, the branch of dental medicine which focuses on restoring health to bone and gum. Their talented team of 10 support personnel consist of their 4 clinical assistants, 3 hygienists and 3 scheduling/billing staff. Perio Atlanta is a “one location”, “owner operated” practice that utilizes the core values of COMMITMENT, OPTIMISM, and INTEGRITY as decision-driving guides.
The team values their amazing network of referring general dentists, long-term relationships with their patients, their close-knit family environment, and the emotional rewards that result from doing one’s best work. They are also grateful for their ability to set their schedule to provide healthy work and non-work life balance such that the team enjoys finishing their workday, on most days, by 3:30PM with every evening and every weekend devoted to family or other non-work priorities.
What is the role of our Business Ops and Personnel Manager?
We are happy to answer that… everything! All kidding aside, the Manager we seek is a gifted communicator. From staff meetings to reviews to handling unexpected twists in the day, their utilization of time and resources to help train, coach, problem solve, resolve unexpected issues, and relay information is efficient and effective. Curious to spark business growth and development, our manager has a knack for numbers, near obsession for accuracy, and an inherent commitment to meet deadlines. Monthly reports on overhead and metrics, payroll records, calculating 401K matches are all tasks produced with ease, after training. The Manager is empathetic to the doctors’ need to devote 100% of their attention during clinical hours to patient care and prioritizes leadership agenda topics to fit well into designated times when the doctors switch their gears to non-clinical practice matters. In the meantime, their initiative, creativity, accuracy, and proactive mindset are qualities that maintain what can appear to be seamless operations even when it’s “one of those days” (like when the power goes out, a patient shows up on the wrong day, and 17 boxes are dropped off by the new UPS guy at the wrong door.) An excellent “people person” the manager is an adept interviewer who can construct orientation and training schedules, utilizing our talented staff, to guide our newest member to achieve success within our organization.
More specifically, Personnel responsibilities include: 
Staff handbook compliance; overseeing documented employment policies on a myriad of topics ranging from federal law compliance, work hours, to professional conduct.
Interviewing when new positions are available on our team.
New hire documentation.
Organizing team building and practice marketing events.
Running routine staff meetings.
Tracking team and individual training initiatives.
Overseeing staff performance in all roles except those specific tasks that require clinical training.
Business Office Management responsibilities include: 
Producing a snapshot report summarizing monthly business metrics and operating expenses.
Monitoring online reviews and feedback; helping to keep patients delighted and happy!
Developing systems, implementing new technologies, and setting standards for staff performance.
Lending support to administrative team members when phones and patient flow are heavier.
Project management for a range of areas from facility issues, marketing, to technology.
Participating in weekly to monthly leadership meetings with our surgeons to foster being a unified leadership team and prioritize business initiatives.
(after industry training) Working closely with patients whose extensive treatment plans require lengthier conversation to discuss payment options, or have questions or circumstances that require research, or whose treatment requires careful coordination with other area specialists.
Is prior dental experience required to apply? 
Simply answered, 
“NO”.
 We can train you in our industry “talk”, systems, and processes. We value your soft skills, business acumen and personnel leadership skills that will adapt well to our industry. A qualified candidate does not need to have prior medical or dental practice management experience to apply (even though that work history is helpful to the learning curve of this position). The following list of criteria is imperative to success:
Initiative to dive-right-in and IMMERSE: observe, study, ask questions, apply answers, youtube for information, and accelerate your industry training.
Minimum 3 years of personnel direct-report supervisory experience within the context of “small business”.
BS or BA from accredited university, ideally, in Business, Healthcare Administration, Communications or related major. Candidates who do not possess a bachelor’s, but whose work experience has provided excellence in education and experience will be considered.
Excellent written and verbal communication skills to be able to sensitively and tactfully have the periodic “tougher conversations” intended to correct actions and gain positive results while minimizing or preventing unnecessarily hurt feelings from staff members.
Technical aptitude to quickly learn software and lead initiatives to improve internal processes and communications.
Quick to build rapport with patients who may have a grievance (most typically related to payment misunderstandings).
Demonstrate/model for staff: our core values, professional conduct, superb communication, excellent tracking of details and follow up, and passion for serving others.
Preference to juggle many tasks and varied responsibilities with the pleasure of seeing how your efforts directly impact the success of the business, your co-workers, and your professional growth.
Stable work history.
Calm and approachable temperament; leading by example.
Compensation and work hours: 
Benefits: Generous employer paid contribution towards medical insurance premium, if needed, 401K, paid time off, paid holidays, free dental cleanings, continuing education, healthy workplace environment, and an awesome work schedule.
Salary: This full-time salaried position will compensate between $60,000 - $75,000/year determined by your job-readiness, skill, and experience.
No weekends hours, no evenings.

Square builds common business tools in unconventional ways so more people can start, run, and grow their businesses. When Square started, it was difficult and expensive (or just plain impossible) for some businesses to take credit cards. Square made credit card payments possible for all by turning a mobile phone into a credit card reader. Since then Square has been building an entire business toolkit of both hardware and software products including Square Capital, Square Terminal, Square Payroll, and more. We’re working to find new and better ways to help businesses succeed on their own terms—and we’re looking for people like you to help shape tomorrow at Square.

Large marketplaces like Amazon have trained us to expect products delivered to our doorsteps within 1-2 days at no extra cost. As a result, millions of sellers on other marketplaces are falling behind, unable to cost-effectively deliver products to their customers. Our mission is to transform the $8-12T fragmented and outdated logistics industry, and build an intelligent, asset-lite network that enables any online seller to offer fast, affordable fulfillment.



Our Team:



How we arrived at Deliverr is different — we are violinists, economists, ex-consultants, journalists, and more. What unites us together is the Deliverr factor: a bias for action, curiosity, and entrepreneurial ownership. We're looking for intelligent, driven, and passionate people to help make our vision a reality. We're based in the heart of San Francisco and building teams around the globe — backed by leading Silicon Valley venture capital firms. If you are excited about joining a people-first company that is driven to power the future of online retail, — we're looking for you. Are you ready?



As a Business Operations & Strategy Associate, you will act as an internal consultant with the ability to execute and affect changes. Reporting to the Head of Business Operations, you will be working on important cross-functional projects such as researching a new market, a new product, productivity improvements or entering a new geographic area. You will have a strong bias for action, an ability to bring multiple internal groups together and drive results.



What you'll do:


Research potential impact of new initiatives through quantitative research.


Define Minimal Viable Product (Experience) for a new initiative, define key success metrics, project plans and resource requirements for success.


Drive the definition and launch of key initiatives by working closely with Operations, Growth, Engineering, Data Science and Finance teams.


Be the sole owner of 1 or more key initiative programs.


Operationalize initiatives after they are successful or move into company operations to lead one of the initiatives.





What we're looking for:


3-5 years of experience including: (1) 2+ years of investment banking, management consulting, or investing and (2) 1+ years in a high growth tech startup.


Proficiency with SQL.


Excellent consultative, communication, and problem-solving skills.


Ability to distill complex issues into structured frameworks and action plans.


Highly analytical, deep experience with reporting tools and ability to pull reports, analyze and get insights.


Ability to thrive in an ambiguous environment with a high degree of autonomy.


Ability to drive consensus across cross-functional teams and influence decision making




Bonus points for:


Working knowledge and understanding of multi-channel online retail such as eBay, Amazon, Walmart or e-commerce fulfillment.

Instacart is the North American leader in online grocery and one of the fastest-growing companies in e-commerce. Since 2012, we've been working towards creating a world where everyone has access to the food they love and more time to enjoy it together.



Groceries delivered to your door in as little as an hour. It seems simple, right? Well, it's more complex than that. From re-routing deliveries during snowstorms, to connecting customers with coupons and deals for their favorite brands, to updating over half a billion grocery data lines every night...our efforts bring Instacart closer to being the operating system for the grocery industry.



Solving these problems is what helps our customers get back time in their day, so they can do more of what they love.

Mechanism is an early-stage venture firm that partners with entrepreneurs to launch and scale ambitious companies.

In our model, we work to identify and validate opportunities before creating every business. We then provide the growth expertise to gain early traction as well as the business support to establish positive unit economics, profitability, and scale.

In addition to investment and strategic guidance, we offer extensive operational support for our startups in critical areas, including Growth Marketing, Product, Engineering, Design, Operations, People, Finance, and Legal. Our in-house experts are at the tops of their fields and are here to provide world-class support and expertise as your company gets off the ground and scales.

Our team has a track record of investing in and cofounding multiple companies with $100M+ revenue.

Position Description

The CEOs of our invested startups join us first as Entrepreneurs in Residence (EIRs). We are looking for new EIRs to join the team who will research business opportunities and become the CEOs of startups we cofound and invest in.

The startups we cofound are mission-driven – focused on improving something that matters – and ultimately grow to a billion-dollar market capitalization over 5-10 years.

The EIR role is salaried and full-time. In this role, you will collaborate with our team to understand the Mechanism startup model while you ideate, research, and prepare to launch your own company.

The EIR program has two phases. In the first phase, you spend a sizable amount of time with the Mechanism cofounders covering a wide variety of topics relevant to launching and scaling startups with rapid profitability. You'll participate in many activities, including working within parts of the Mechanism business, potentially alongside other startups we've cofounded. This phase also includes iterative MVP builds and concept tests that will inform your eventual startup.

You won't be just learning theoretical concepts – real-world market performance is paramount to our model.

In the second phase of the program, we fund your startup, and you officially become a CEO. Over the next few quarters, you'll work closely and iteratively with the Mechanism cofounders and other in-house teams to test and scale offerings that drive early profitability, with a focus on moving from default dead to default alive and becoming an expert in your space. From there, you'll continue to scale your business, hiring in-house teams and expanding your product or service offerings – all-the-while continuing to test and rapidly iterate.

Each EIR is afforded a high amount of independence and autonomy, as well as a significant ownership stake in your eventual startup.

You are not required to bring a fully developed business idea into the EIR program. We are looking for the right people first and then develop the right ideas second.


What You’ll Do

Learn and internalize the Mechanism startup model.

Work within different parts of the Mechanism business, focusing on areas that augment and build out your startup founder skill sets.

Research, analyze, and test the viability of business ideas.

Brainstorm solutions and validate them with representative customers.

Clarify and verify value propositions and key features.

Devise and validate go-to-market strategies for different business ideas.


Who You Are

Prior experience as a startup founder or previously worked at an early-stage company.

Demonstrated experience building businesses and leading teams.

Adept at recruiting, evaluating, and coaching team members.

Enjoy working and thrive in a fast-paced and ever-changing environment.

Strong analytical skills and enthusiasm for data-driven decision making and marketing.

A test-and-learn mindset as the idea continues to evolve.

Interest in driving change, adoption, and scaling a business from scratch.

Convey complex concepts and ideas in simple terms.

Extreme grit, integrity, determination, resilience, and relentless resourcefulness.

You are genuine and bring an enthusiastic, professional demeanor. We have a very strict no-jerk policy and do not tolerate intellectual arrogance.


What To Expect

While the EIR program is different for each person – tailored to individual strengths and background – below is a general sense of what you may expect over the first three months of joining the team:

In 30 Days

Start collaborating with the Mechanism team and onboard into the EIR program.

Help with or temporarily lead Mechanism or portfolio startup initiatives.

Begin leading EIR strategy sessions with Mechanism cofounders to identify future business opportunities for your eventual startup.

Research industries and opportunities identified in strategy sessions.

In 60 Days

Continue to help with, or temporarily lead, Mechanism or portfolio startup initiatives – focusing on wrapping up work and/or transitioning ownership to other team members.

Continue leading EIR strategy sessions with the Mechanism team to explore business opportunities.

Rapid feasibility testing, building MVPs, and running tests to determine the viability of potential strategies and approaches for establishing early profitability of your eventual startup.

In 90-120 Days

Wind down or transition ownership of any remaining Mechanism or portfolio startup initiatives.

Complete feasibility testing and research.

Prepare to become the CEO of your own startup.


Compensation

The salary for the EIR program is $200k annually. We also cover all associated costs, such as research, experimentation, and feasibility studies. After you become the CEO of your startup, compensation moves to a base salary of $120k plus autonomy and a sizable equity stake in your startup. Beyond this point, changes to compensation are discussed and agreed upon as board-level decisions.

Time Commitment

This role is full time.

Location

We are fully remote. You can work wherever you’re most productive.","{'business': 0.00895314096256701, 'work': 0.007467695519461106, 'sizable': 0.0059842569832545545, 'mechanism': 0.005715364969516921, 'join': 0.005064834969403842, 'profitability': 0.004902098465164212, 'venture': 0.004563890805822165, 'firm': 0.004563890805822165, 'partners': 0.004563890805822165, 'ambitious': 0.004563890805822165, 'creating': 0.004563890805822165, 'every': 0.004563890805822165, 'gain': 0.004563890805822165, 'traction': 0.004563890805822165, 'establish': 0.004563890805822165, 'positive': 0.004563890805822165, 'unit': 0.004563890805822165, 'economics': 0.004563890805822165, 'addition': 0.004563890805822165, 'investment': 0.004563890805822165, 'strategic': 0.004563890805822165, 'guidance': 0.004563890805822165, 'offer': 0.004563890805822165, 'extensive': 0.004563890805822165, 'operational': 0.004563890805822165, 'critical': 0.004563890805822165, 'engineering': 0.004563890805822165, 'design': 0.004563890805822165, 'operations': 0.004563890805822165, 'finance': 0.004563890805822165, 'legal': 0.004563890805822165, 'experts': 0.004563890805822165, 'tops': 0.004563890805822165, 'fields': 0.004563890805822165, 'worldclass': 0.004563890805822165, 'gets': 0.004563890805822165, 'ground': 0.004563890805822165, 'scales': 0.004563890805822165, 'track': 0.004563890805822165, 'record': 0.004563890805822165, 'investing': 0.004563890805822165, 'cofounding': 0.004563890805822165, 'multiple': 0.004563890805822165, 'revenue': 0.004563890805822165, 'position': 0.004563890805822165, 'invested': 0.004563890805822165, 'us': 0.004563890805822165, 'residence': 0.004563890805822165, 'new': 0.004563890805822165, 'invest': 0.004563890805822165, 'missiondriven': 0.004563890805822165, 'focused': 0.004563890805822165, 'improving': 0.004563890805822165, 'something': 0.004563890805822165, 'matters': 0.004563890805822165, 'ultimately': 0.004563890805822165, 'grow': 0.004563890805822165, 'billiondollar': 0.004563890805822165, 'capitalization': 0.004563890805822165, 'years': 0.004563890805822165, 'salaried': 0.004563890805822165, 'fulltime': 0.004563890805822165, 'collaborate': 0.004563890805822165, 'understand': 0.004563890805822165, 'ideate': 0.004563890805822165, 'two': 0.004563890805822165, 'phases': 0.004563890805822165, 'spend': 0.004563890805822165, 'covering': 0.004563890805822165, 'wide': 0.004563890805822165, 'variety': 0.004563890805822165, 'topics': 0.004563890805822165, 'relevant': 0.004563890805822165, 'launching': 0.004563890805822165, 'participate': 0.004563890805822165, 'many': 0.004563890805822165, 'activities': 0.004563890805822165, 'potentially': 0.004563890805822165, 'alongside': 0.004563890805822165, 'weve': 0.004563890805822165, 'cofounded': 0.004563890805822165, 'includes': 0.004563890805822165, 'iterative': 0.004563890805822165, 'mvp': 0.004563890805822165, 'builds': 0.004563890805822165, 'concept': 0.004563890805822165, 'inform': 0.004563890805822165, 'wont': 0.004563890805822165, 'learning': 0.004563890805822165, 'theoretical': 0.004563890805822165, 'realworld': 0.004563890805822165, 'performance': 0.004563890805822165, 'paramount': 0.004563890805822165, 'fund': 0.004563890805822165, 'officially': 0.004563890805822165, 'next': 0.004563890805822165, 'quarters': 0.004563890805822165, 'closely': 0.004563890805822165, 'iteratively': 0.004563890805822165, 'drive': 0.004563890805822165}"
