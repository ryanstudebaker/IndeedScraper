We started Generally Intelligent because we believe that software with human-level intelligence will have a transformative impact on the world. We’re dedicated to ensuring that that impact is a positive one.
We have enough funding to last for decades, and our backers include Y Combinator, researchers from OpenAI, Lightspeed, Threshold, and many others.
This role is about leading a team of research engineers to investigate the fundamental questions of intelligence, knowledge and understanding in support of developing software with human level intelligence.
About the role
You will run experiments in order to more deeply understand both the current solutions (e.g., what specific deep neural networks are learning) and the current problems (e.g., what about the training data makes it difficult to learn the patterns that seem so obvious to us).
You will work closely with other researcher engineers on your team in order to run those experiments. You will delegate and coordinate significant portions of the work in order to make more progress than you could on your own.
You will pair program with other researchers and research engineers. We find pair programming particularly useful because ML code needs a high level of correctness.
You will mentor other engineers and help them become better at doing machine learning research.
You will read research and conduct your own literature reviews to identify relevant baselines, find new architectures and techniques that we might want to incorporate, and generally stay current in the field.
You will participate in (our own unique version of) daily stand-ups, research planning, strategy discussions, paper clubs, learn-a-thons, and other activities designed to give us space to learn and plan and think.
About you
You are excited to lead and mentor a small team of great research engineers as we explore the practical issues that are fundamentally in the way of us building more general, powerful, robust AI systems.
You are a graduate of (or currently enrolled in) a PhD program in the field of machine learning (or equivalent experience, e.g., in industry or on your own time). Ideal candidates will have published multiple papers in top venues (or at least submitted many papers—we recognize that the process is flawed and are happy to review your work ourselves).
You are either a very strong software engineer, 
or
 you have significant research experience (as a post-doc, professor, or industry researcher)
About us
we believe in working with the absolute best people in the world (which is why we pay top of market)
we believe that there is somethings special about getting the most talented people together in one room, especially for research (which is why we’re fully in-person in SF)
we believe that curiosity and personal growth are both extremely important (which is why you will have a $30K+ yearly budget for executive coaching, books, courses, conferences, etc)
we believe that it is critical to not just attract great individuals, but build strong relationships between them (whichis why we have quarterly team off-sites, frequent team dinners, and other events)
we believe in investing in resources so that you can work more effectively (which is why we have a $250K+ compute budget per person, dedicated contract engineers to support our researchers individually, why we’ve built internal tools to automate hyper-parameter optimization, etc)
we believe in creating a culture of science and truth-seeking, where no idea is too crazy to consider and no ideas are considered holy (which is why we encourage questions in the middle of company-wide presentations and why we force the most junior members in a meeting to weigh in first)
we also believe in creating a culture of psychological safety, where everyone feels able to voice their opinion without fear of judgment (which is why we have “Feelings Friday”, where we have space to share how we felt during the week, and why we have a culture manual with a bunch of small habits that help encourage safe, effective communication)
we believe in having fun, and that being in a positive environment isn't just much more productive, it's just a better way to live (which is why we take Friday afternoons off together as a team, joke around, and join in each others’ hobbies, whether it’s D&D or hiking or meditation)
we believe that creating software with human level intelligence comes with the responsibility to ensure that it benefits all of humanity, not just a select few (which is why we're creating a public benefit corporation, why we’re interested in safety research , and why we have internal working groups on safety).
How to apply
All submissions are reviewed by a person, so we encourage you to include a cover letter. If you have any other work that you can showcase (open source code, side projects, etc), you should certainly include it!
We try to reply either way within a week or two at most (usually much sooner).
We know that talent comes from many backgrounds, and with many different skills and preferences. That’s why we have a hiring process that gives you the ability to showcase yourself in a variety of different ways, depending on what feels best for you.

At GSK we see a world in which advanced applications of machine learning and AI will allow us to develop novel therapies to existing diseases and to quickly respond to emerging or changing diseases with personalized drugs, driving better outcomes at reduced cost with fewer side effects. It is an ambitious vision that will require the development of products and solutions at the cutting edge of machine learning and AI. If that excites you, we'd love to chat.

The AIML Sequence Learning Team applies machine learning and AI methods to DNA and RNA sequence data from large-scale human genetic, functional genomic and single cell experiments. DNA sequence variations are linked to disease via changes in the nature and abundance of protein and RNA gene products. The Sequence Learning group builds models directly from DNA/RNA sequence in addition to other data sources such as chromatin state. Models that operate on a sequence level can infer changes in protein/RNA states and the associated cellular function from sequence alone. This is an exciting methodological advance at the intersection of NLP inspired language models applied to biological data.

We're looking for a highly accomplished 
AI/ML Engineer

At GSK we see a world in which advanced applications of machine learning and AI will allow us to develop novel therapies to existing diseases and to quickly respond to emerging or changing diseases with personalized drugs, driving better outcomes at reduced cost with fewer side effects. It is an ambitious vision that will require the development of products and solutions at the cutting edge of machine learning and AI. If that excites you, we'd love to chat.

The AIML Sequence Learning Team applies machine learning and AI methods to DNA and RNA sequence data from large-scale human genetic, functional genomic and single cell experiments. DNA sequence variations are linked to disease via changes in the nature and abundance of protein and RNA gene products. The Sequence Learning group builds models directly from DNA/RNA sequence in addition to other data sources such as chromatin state. Models that operate on a sequence level can infer changes in protein/RNA states and the associated cellular function from sequence alone. This is an exciting methodological advance at the intersection of NLP inspired language models applied to biological data.

We're looking for a Senior AI/ML Engineer to join our team. Competitive candidates will have in-depth knowledge of machine learning with a track record in developing deep learning models for solving challenging real world scientific problems. You should be inspired by the potential of applying machine learning to biology and the associated impact on human health.

This role will require you to work with scientists in related disciplines to translate biological/drug discovery challenges into well-defined machine learning problems. This will require you to execute and deliver a full AI/ML driven solution from sourcing training data, designing and implementing new machine learning models, testing, benchmarking and managing product driven research for model performance improvement, to shipping stable, tested, performant code and services in an agile environment.

Educational or professional background in the biological sciences is a plus. The AI/ML team is built on the principles of ownership, accountability, continuous development, and collaboration. We hire for the long term, and we're motivated to make this a great place to work. Our leaders will be committed to your career and development from day one.

Basic Qualifications:

We are looking for professionals with these required skills to achieve our goals:

Graduate studies in Computer Science or Applied Math, undergraduate studies in Computer Science and relevant graduate studies in the life sciences with a focus on AI/ML techniques, or undergraduate studies in Computer Science and equivalent work history.

Context: 
Every year companies are forced to reinvent interviews for the same ~100 professional roles, 500M times. Interviewing is slow, biased, lacks prediction, and candidates rarely get what they deserve.
Hireguide is a platform that lets hiring teams interview like experts for any role in minutes. We’re sharing what works from thousands of real questions, recordings and ratings, all analyzed by advanced natural language processing. For companies Hireguide makes interview preparation 20X faster, decisions twice as predictive and top candidates more likely to say yes. For candidates Hireguide delivers clearer interview instructions, a voice in the process, and actionable feedback. For society, Hireguide is a BCorp democratizing access to fairer interviewing.
The experience we offer: 
Develop skills on the cutting edge of AI tech, applying NLP / Conversational AI to Talent conversations

Learn to differentiate product through human centric design and ease of use
Hire and manage a large Product and Design team within a year
Mentoring by industry experts (including human centric design training)

8-10 years experience building web based software from ideation, launch, to refinement (ideally: within AI / NLP, in HR, SaaS, B2B, 8+ years experience, managed others)
Balanced skill between 1) strategy and execution, 2) creativity and critical thinking, 3) customer and engineering empathy
Track record of accountability and results throughout lifetime (history of success)
Top seven skills under evaluation (ranked): 
1) Structured Problem Solving, 2) Product Management, 3) UX Design, 4) Coding Knowledge, 5) Agile 6) Managing Self 7) Managing Others
Total reward transparency: 
This role can be based anywhere in the US (preferred), Canada (preferred), UK/EU or Australia. Foundational hires are paid annual cash between $150-200k USD to maintain a comfortable lifestyle, but meaningful founding-team equity is the heart of the compensation upside. Founding team equity is expected to be worth multi-millions within a few years, potentially a lot more when we achieve our vision. We also offer competitive benefits, remote work, international offsites, four weeks vacation. Required to travel to California (Bay Area and/or Santa Monica) multiple times per year, health safety permitting.

By the end of 2020, contingent workers made up nearly 40% of the US workforce, and that number is growing steadily year after year.

At Sense, we are reinventing the way staffing agencies build long-term relationships with their workforce. We obsess over the candidate experience, always looking for ways to improve how staffing agencies communicate and engage with talent before, during and after each assignment. Sense is a rapidly growing company, and our engineering team is the best environment for people looking for challenges, ownership, and learning opportunities.




Job Description

Our customers say that finding the right candidates at the right time can be like finding a needle in a haystack. Sense, however, makes the whole process a lot less labor intensive for them. Agencies using Sense unlock the real power of recruiters, who don’t have to spend most of their time managing mechanical and repetitive tasks.

One of the most powerful tools in our portfolio is the virtual assistant, which we call Reva (Recruiting Virtual Assistant). Reva proactively reaches out to candidates to ensure their information is as accurate as possible, pre-screens them, schedules interviews with the recruitment team, and does a lot more.

The assistant is the first of many projects that relies on Machine Learning to make our products more intelligent and powerful, and we need your help to make our vision a reality. If you have experience building reliable and scalable infrastructure and are passionate about ML, then this is the perfect opportunity for you!

In this role, you’ll work at the intersection of Machine Learning, DevOps and Data Engineering, and you’ll be responsible for deploying and maintaining ML systems in production reliably and efficiently.

Design and build scalable automation pipelines to train, test, and deploy ML models for a variety of AI products

Given requirements around availability, scalability, performance, observability and recoverability, come up with complete designs for ML platforms in staging and production environments

Given requirements from our Data Science team around experimentation and verification, build on-demand services to improve their productivity

Hold reusability, extensibility, right separation of concerns in high importance while designing at data & service levels

Own quality & performance “measures” of service/application, and work towards constantly & consistently improving on the same.

Mentor other engineering team members through code reviews, pair programming etc.

About You:

Bachelor’s degree in computer science or other highly technical scientific discipline

4+ years of experience with AWS services

2+ years of experience with deployment systems like Jenkins, CI/CD pipelines.

Experience with distributed storage technologies like NFS, HDFS, Ceph, S3 as well as dynamic resource management frameworks (Mesos, Kubernetes, Yarn)

Job Description

Our customers say that finding the right candidates at the right time can be like finding a needle in a haystack. Sense, however, makes the whole process a lot less labor intensive for them. Agencies using Sense unlock the real power of recruiters, who don’t have to spend most of their time managing mechanical and repetitive tasks.

One of the most powerful tools in our portfolio is the virtual assistant, which we call Reva (Recruiting Virtual Assistant), aka the Chatbot. Reva today can handle tasks such as scheduling meetings, collecting information from candidates, find the best jobs for them based on this information, and even prescreen them. All conversations are fully designed by our customers, who can build, test, and send conversations to candidates or internal employees in a click of a button. But there's much more we (and our customers) want it to do.



With a growing number of customers and use cases, we need your help making Reva better, smarter, and capable of understanding a lot more than it can today. If you are a seasoned ML engineer (or data scientists with experience in applied ML), you are passionate about dialog systems, natural language processing, and/or textual analysis, this is the right opportunity for you!




Responsibilities:

Ship cutting-edge AI to businesses that traditionally haven't had access to it

Iteratively improve an AI system with thousands of requests per day

Work with Backend and Frontend engineers to ship features relying on ML predictions

Work cross collaboratively with product managers and designers to improve and define product scope and design.

Mentor other engineering team members through code reviews, pair programming etc.
