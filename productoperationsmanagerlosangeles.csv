The Heal product platform is revolutionizing the healthcare experience by putting patients first. We are the undisputed market leader in doctor house calls, telemedicine and remote patient monitoring - using technology to make care delivery smart, efficient and highly personal. We obsess about every detail to ensure that we continue to extend our paradigm-shifting lead to deliver convenience, choice and transformative care to each and every one of our patients.



Make your work matter. Your unique contributions and technical ideas can make a rewarding impact on millions of lives in modernizing the healthcare industry.



Heal has delivered over 150,000 house calls and driven over $60+ million in healthcare cost savings. We are proud to mention our very wide range of notable investors, including: Paul Jacobs, Jeb Bush, Breyer Capital, IRA Capital, Trans-Pacific Technology Fund, Lionel Richie, and more. Additionally, we have won numerous distinguished awards, including: the Web Marketing Association 2018 MobileWebAward for Best Health Care Mobile Application, Top 50 in Digital Health, Most Tech-Friendly Provider, Fierce Innovation Awards - Healthcare 2017, Global Healthcare Magazine: Top 10 Healthcare CEOs, Top 40 Healthcare Transformers of 2018, Disruptor Daily's Top 25 Influencers Shaping the Future of Healthcare, 10 CEOs transforming healthcare in America', CES Innovation Awards, and more. Heal has over 100 major corporate clients and is covered as an in-network benefit with Aetna, Anthem Blue Cross, Blue Shield of California, CareFirst, Cigna, Health Net, Medicare, and United Healthcare. Heal house calls are available across California, Atlanta, Georgia, and Northern Virginia/D.C.



We are changing lives all around the nation. Great people working towards our mission allows for this progress, which is where you come in.



The Role:



The Heal product platform is revolutionizing the healthcare experience by putting patients first. We obsess about every detail to ensure that we continue to extend our paradigm-shifting lead to deliver convenience, choice and transformative care to each and every one of our patients.



We are looking for an insanely detail-oriented and hard working individual to manage Heal's Operations tools across mobile (iOS and responsive web) and desktop (Web), as well as their backend and critical third-party EMR and billing integrations. We expect you to own the product development cycle, from idea and data, to prototyping and design, to requirements gathering and ticketing, APIs and integration, to user-testing and release.



The Heal Operations platform has two sets of complementary users: Clinical teams (our medical teams) and Operations (our logistics, patient support and billing systems). These users work together to deliver care to our patients, so these systems must be fluid, robust, scalable, and reliable. We treat these users with as much love as we do our core users, our patients, because a world class experience in our internal tools means that our clinical and internal operational teams can deliver the best possible care.



We therefore pride ourselves in spearheading a paradigm-shift in 
provider
 user experience design: we apply the same principles found in the world's best consumer-grade apps to our internal and clinical provider tools. We are looking for a person who shares these values and will relish the opportunity to rigorously ensure that Heal's tools are the industry-defining antithesis to legacy and incumbent 'ugly and broken' approaches to healthcare software.



About You:




Previous experience with implementation and/or integration with CRM platforms, such as SalesForce would be ideal. Prior experience with front-desk patient management software, EMR, EHR, API integrations, call-center software, customer support systems, task management platforms, and other operations-related platforms would be a real bonus.


Data-driven approach to converting KPIs into metrics and analytics for the products and solutions you build, and the desire to personally measure, report and iterate towards achieving those KPISs. Prior experience with analytics tools, such as Tableau a must.


A keen understanding of HEDIS, Five-Star Quality Ratings, care gap closures, value-based care, care quality, and economics incentives metrics would be a real bonus.


Possess a fundamental understanding that the Heal Operations tools are used directly before, during and after the delivery of patient care and are therefore mission-critical.


Heal's internal tools shouldn't require manuals to operate - and you are not fond of writing them.


Deeply passionate about designing a user experience for our clinical and operations teams that is fundamentally paradoxical: functionally complex, yet delightful.


Expected to remain in full sync with your product counterpart in Heal's Clinical platform, to ensure that every change on the back-end or internal tools is supported by the front-end, and vice versa.


Apply a systematic yet pragmatic approach to gathering requirements from clinical and operational stakeholders, with a resource-driven analytical approach to determining what to prioritize and when to compromise - without leaving one user group's roadmap feeling less loved than the other.


Solid track record in an agile startup environment where you have been responsible for turning verbal ideas or data-driven analysis rapidly into formal requirements, through wireframing and prototyping and ticket creation, through to user acceptance testing and post-release QA, roadmap management and data analysis, to ensure absolute quality in the end-to-end product.


Proven to consistently deliver a clean and polished user experience, whether through your keen sense of knowing how to turn an idea into physical reality, or your analytical approach to data and usage patterns to inform product development strategy.


Technically minded, yet creatively aware. You must be willing and able to quickly absorb very complex business logic, clinical logic, impacted heavily by externally governed industry regulations, health insurance and billing systems APIs, EMR (Electronic Medical Records) integrations, ever-changing partners' business rules, and a multi-layered internal tech stack.


Not afraid to adapt to a very fast-paced environment and supporting an existing business model, while testing and micro-pivoting to new ones.


Able to work closely with a disparate - yet unified by a common mission - set of user groups and stakeholders; and willing to balance competing priorities, from clinical, to operations, to business development.


Technically comfortable with contributing to and confidently participating in critical systems architecture conversations with our Engineering group, since decision-making in this arena - whether around security, scalability, API availability, reporting, integrations, or infrastructure - affects the performance and user experience in our internal operational tools.


Background in healthcare is a bonus (you won't need to learn the 'ins and outs' of health insurance or regulations on UX through trial and error) but not a prerequisite (you haven't been brainwashed in the incumbent approaches to delivering a digital healthcare experience).





What we need:




Prepared to be involved in the full range of the product management cycle, from strategizing around product roadmap and presenting to stakeholders, to rolling up your sleeves and writing tickets and mocking up wireframes. We are too young a company for a PowerPoint strategist, and too mature for a ticket jockey.


We are an agile environment, so we expect you to move quickly, demonstrating poise while holding together many threads across stakeholders, including clinical teams, operations teams, engineering, design and QA, to owning the end-to-end delivery of a world-class user experience.


An expert communicator, who can translate complex requirements into simple direction, while frequently communicating status to each team in an equally concise and precise manner.


The fundamentals: seasoned experience with an array of ticketing systems (e.g. JIRA), prototyping software (e.g. Sketch), and data analytics tools (e.g. Metabase)


Knowledge of clinical, health insurance and systems, medical records technology and APIs is a significant bonus but not a deal-killer.

The Opportunity:

Netflix is seeking a Manager, Business & Legal Affairs, Studio Operations and Partnerships.

The rapidly growing Studio Operations and Partnerships team within the Content Legal organization at Netflix encompasses visual effects (VFX), post-production, dubbing, content and product globalization, studio infrastructure, virtual production, physical production, and is quickly expanding into additional studio functions. To support these efforts, we are seeking an exceptional and experienced legal professional to be our Manager of Business & Legal Affairs.

The Manager will work closely with the Post-Production/Production Planning, VFX/Virtual Production, and Dubbing/Globalization Business & Legal Affairs teams to provide transactional high-level paralegal support, legal operations coordination, and organizational efficiency. This support will include: recognizing the need for contract forms, trackers and legal administration; drafting master service agreements, quitclaims, statements of work, and other basic legal documents; liaising with internal business partners to gather information necessary for contract negotiations and legal vetting; tracking the execution of documents and arranging for timely renewals and amendments for existing agreements; conducting periodic reviews of vendor forms to ensure ongoing compliance with Netflix and legal requirements; and establishing and formulating workflows and RACIs to facilitate smooth collaboration with internal partners. The Manager will work cross-functionally with the many teams that make and use creative assets across all content genres.

Requirements:

The successful candidate will welcome the opportunity to be part of a fast-paced, growing team, and will exhibit excellent judgment in execution. This person will thrive in an environment that values thoughtful efficiency over blind adherence to process, and they will be comfortable engaging and networking with our global, multicultural and multilingual colleagues around the world.

This candidate must:

be one of the following: paralegal or legal professional with 8+ years contract administration and drafting experience; or business affairs professional with 5+ years solid negotiation experience at a VFX, post-production or dubbing facility;

be familiar with either the vendor and supply-chain space, or filmed entertainment production, digital production, post-production, and dubbing;

possess outstanding written communication, contract drafting, negotiation skills, and internal networking abilities;

demonstrate substantive knowledge of contract law principles;

strong organizational and project management skills, allowing many projects to keep moving simultaneously; and

solid foundation and willingness to learn about administrative tools and management databases.

The successful candidate will also possess the following abilities and traits:

the ability to maintain a team-oriented approach while also making independent decisions under tight deadlines with imperfect information;

the ability to discern when “process” is an encumbrance and when it is an efficiency driver;

a solution-oriented mindset;

the willingness to tackle matters, and the capacity to contribute effectively, outside one’s area of expertise;

the willingness to adapt and to embrace change with enthusiasm;

the courage to challenge prevailing assumptions, and the insight to suggest better approaches;

a knack for making connections that other miss;

a default approach that favors sharing information openly and proactively;

experience working with external legal management tools (e.g., iManage, Evisort) and internal proprietary technology tooling; and

language skills in addition to English (not required, but a strong plus).

Project Manager, Cinema Operations

Description

Position Title

Project Manager

Position Summary

The Project Manager will work with the Studio Support Account teams to help schedule and track Mastering work during the specified work shift. Internally this position will be working directly with all of Deluxe Digital Cinema’s production departments.

The Project Manager in this role will utilize a proprietary Work Order automation system called Kraken, which Project Managers must quickly become proficient in. This system distributes available tasks to operators—and in some cases Supervisors—through a work order ‘queueing’ platform that is managed by our team. Priority is adjusted throughout the day to meet project deadlines such as client scheduling and product delivery.

Priority is determined through communiques we maintain with Account Management teams, who organize deliverables on the client’s behalf. We receive project details via email, group and private messaging, in-person directives, and in some cases, directly from the client. We apply these updates to the database for consumption by the operators, who will modify and/or expedite the product based on our additions.

In order to transpose work orders correctly, Project Managers must correlate the total product output (per shift) against available resources, including staffing and equipment particulars. A fundamental understanding of digital delivery, DCP creation, quality control practices, and print distribution is essential and provides the language needed to assist team members in surmounting production obstacles.

All candidates must have an understanding of the Digital Cinema Packaging workflow, as well as a basic knowledge of the DI workflow. The Project Manager must be a good communicator, be well organized, work well in a team environment, and have the ability to facilitate multiple projects in a fast paced environment. The Project Manager must be flexible to work whatever shift is available including nights and weekends as well as work overtime as required by the business needs.

Main Duties

• Helping the Account Teams to keep project(s) on a specific timeline for completion

• Working with Post facilities and vendors to facilitate delivery of source materials

• Working with the vault to receive and confirm delivery of source materials

• Scheduling of mastering processes from encoding through QC

• Creation of Work Orders in DTDC’s proprietary Work Flow system

• Scheduling of both internal QC and Client QC screenings

• Organization and tracking of International Versioning of projects (Subbed and Dubbed, 2D and 3D) through the encoding, wrapping, and QC stages

• Communicating with clients for the Account Team when required

• Other duties as assigned by direct supervisor


Systems and Applications Requirements

• General Microsoft Office Suite (Outlook, Word, and Excel)

• Various Digital Cinema Playback Systems (Doremi, Dolby, SONY, etc.)

• Various Digital Cinema Projectors

• Digital Cinema Ancillary equipment (Closed Captioning Devices, DBOX, 3D Viewing systems, etc.)

• Filemaker Pro (ENIGMA)

• Kraken

• Slack

We offer competitive pay and a comprehensive benefits program including medical, dental & vision coverage, vacation & sick leave, 401(k), and more.

Ranker is seeking a stellar Editorial Operations Manager where you will take ownership of the operational aspects of our Publishing Operations team. We have already built sophisticated products that have gained significant market traction; we are looking for you to immediately add layer(s) of value to take us to the next level.
The Editorial Operations Manager will be hands-on across the following key areas: leading operations & people facilitations, being hands-on & having an holistic understanding of traffic sources, and defining “search intent optimization” with their eyes closed in one sentence.
The perfect candidate will be energized by the opportunity to pioneer solutions and evolve our existing, repeatable offerings. You will support the evolution and evangelizing of Ranker (and Watchworthy) content offerings.
As the Editorial Operations Manager, you will report to the Chief Operating Officer. And, if you have the desire to lead people, you’ll have that opportunity in this role.
What You'll Do
Manage our PubOps team with a natural gift in growing, mentoring, coaching people which almost always aids in performance and the attainment of delivering above and beyond. Carry over your outside experience to show us what we don’t know.
Analyze Content Programming to ensure that we’re making the best content for our various audiences
Use your “content & intent brain” to analyze and iterate on KPIs spanning across content made for both search intent and social audiences
Know and always think of creative ways on how to keep someone visiting on site longer, while understanding the differences in intent/page type, social vs search, etc
Rally. Rally. Rally and serve your team by keeping an eye on the bigger picture of people, team dynamics, performance through your coaching and mentoring skills
General editorial ops tasks such as onboarding of new team members, documentation and recruiting (vetting candidates and coordination)
What You’ll Bring
Shown track-record of at least 10+ years of editorial operations experience
Strong understanding of mobile and web technologies and industries (preferably in the web publisher or internet space)
Demonstrated and focused desire to lead and build up people through coaching and mentoring
Baseline level of knowledge of publishing operations and inner workings
Strategic thinking combined with excellent time management and organizational skill towards planned, deadline driven execution
Seasoned solutions orientated thinking and problem-solving skills
Self-motivation and the capacity to work under pressure and tight deadlines.
Ability to thrive in a fast-paced, intellectually-demanding and data-driven environment
Ability to manage time and schedules to meet aggressive deadlines and influence through persuasive written and verbal communication
Ability to set and manage expectations at the executive level and manage up
Excellent leadership skills with experience collaborating with cross-functional teams
Experience with Jira, or other issue-tracking software
Experience with Adobe Analytics, Google Analytics, or other analytics software
A general knowledge or interest of pop culture (and super deep nerdiness is never frowned upon here!)
Experience around content, understanding of the realities of 21st century web traffic with a head for using data
An understanding of how consumers navigate content and how to tie it together in a scalable way (product/editorial intersection)
What You’ll Receive
Fully-paid medical, plus heavily subsidized voluntary dental and vision plans.
Paid holidays, plus additional days of paid time off per year.
Very casual workplace (t-shirts and shorts are totally fine) with a fully stocked kitchen including free healthy snacks, Perrier, LaCroix, Mexican Coca-Cola etc.
