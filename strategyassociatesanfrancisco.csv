Our clients can access our investment solutions through a variety of product structures, including individual and institutional separate accounts, mutual funds and other pooled investment vehicles, and the industry-leading iShares® ETFs.


Job background

We believe the future of ETF distribution is digital. As ETF adoption skyrockets around the world, we have an outstanding opportunity to shape how the investment industry will evolve. We are on a mission to transform iShares.com, to champion investor progress by creating the most trusted, valued and relevant digital experience. Are you with us?


We are building out a digital product management function, and we’re looking for a senior product manager to oversee some of our key US initiatives and activate on this opportunity.


As a product manager, you will be responsible for understanding the business priorities and our clients’ needs, bringing the two together to drive commercial success. This includes leading a cross-functional team to implement the strategy, roadmap, development, and activation of iShares.com – owning its overall success.


To deliver the product, you will work with a cross-functional team with some regional dispersion. Additionally, the structure of the business means you will operate in a matrixed fashion with multiple partner teams. As you develop and execute the strategy and roadmap you will need to skillfully solve for this complexity of users and partners and take people on the journey with you. Additionally, you will partner closely with other internal digital distribution groups to ensure we are bringing the best of the full BlackRock platform to clients.


As you build your understanding of our clients, you will identify other unmet client needs and opportunities for new digital products. In these cases, you will scope the business case, conceptualize and pitch these ideas.



You’ll be customer-first advocate who is a confident communicator, super organized, resilient and respectfully anti-bureaucratic.

Communicate product strategy so internal partners understand what we are focused on and why


Use deep customer insight to evolve the iShares websites to improve customer experience and develop new product propositions


Help us implement good product management practice, including regular metric sharing


Keep leadership up to date with the team’s progress and provide a realistic picture of what is achievable with the resources at hand


Stay on top of the competitor landscape and make this a regular practice


Coach the team to run at the problem in the right way, using the right discovery techniques and tools, and ensure our product team is delivering the right things, at speed


Work with marketing, PR, and other business partners on promotional plans to ensure that strategies are coordinated


Ensure that cross-functional processes are smooth and inbound requests, maintenance and critical issues are swiftly resolved


Represent the firm and the product by visiting clients to solicit feedback, and be flexible to travel for client insights




Essential skills / experience

2+ of years experience owning the development of awesome digital products and propositions, leading all aspects of a successful product throughout its lifecycle


Excellent written and verbal communication skills with ability to build excitement and consensus among the core team, our partner groups and executive management


Ability to take complex customer and business problems, break them down in a clear, structured way and build novel, creative solutions that solve business and client needs


Experience with using agile to build a transparent, inclusive and focused environment for teams of 5-10 designers, engineers, and SMEs to deliver their best work


Proven track record driving an initiative to completion, making informed trade-offs as new information emerges and sweating the last 5% of the details that make a product our users love and our team is proud of


Supremely organized and able to prioritize your time to have the greatest impact on the team and on our initiatives


Skilled at working effectively with cross functional teams in a matrix organization


Flexible, collaborative, empathetic leader who doesn’t mind getting hands on when required to help the team


Curiosity for our business, clients and mission




Our benefits



To help you stay energized, engaged and inspired, we offer a wide range of benefits including a strong retirement plan, tuition reimbursement, comprehensive healthcare, support for working parents and Flexible Time Off (FTO) so you can relax, recharge and be there for the people you care about.

Research associates work as part of research teams and under the direction of a senior research colleague, who provides guidance, review, and mentorship. Key responsibilities include assisting the Criminal Justice team in coding and analyzing large and complex quantitative data, conducting literature searches, abstracting source materials, and presenting research in progress at project and research group meetings. The ideal candidate will have experience cleaning, assembling, and preparing large data sets for research purposes and a demonstrated interest in criminal justice policy.


This position is based in PPIC’s San Francisco office.


The PPIC Criminal Justice research group works to create a common understanding about challenges and opportunities in the criminal justice system, criminal behavior and the nature of crime in California, and policies and strategies that lead to safe and thriving communities across the state.


In the Criminal Justice group our work addresses three overarching areas:


Improving community re-entry: To address the state’s stubbornly high recidivism rates and thereby promote safer communities across the state, we evaluate policy and programs aimed at improving programming, health and well-being, and recidivism during and/or after prison


Addressing racial disparity in the criminal justice system: We establish facts regarding where and how disparities arise at each stage of justice system involvement—and even prior to “official” justice system involvement, such as with police stops


Understanding criminal justice outcomes and analyzing impacts of state-level policy reforms: We provide independent information on crime and public safety, including crime, arrest, and recidivism to support constructive decision-making




Responsibilities


Construct and manage large, complex data sets


Clean and analyze quantitative data


Contribute to regular project and research group meetings


Perform literature searches, prepare and annotate bibliographies, and abstract data source materials


Assist in drafting research reports, including producing data visualizations and writing parts of technical appendices


Contact government agencies and other organizations to request data and other program information


Interact with external stakeholders


Perform administrative tasks as required

Research associates are integral members of PPIC’s research team. As their expertise develops, so do the opportunities to expand their level of responsibility regarding the stewardship of project-related work, the intellectual contribution to projects, or both.


Qualifications


Bachelors or Master’s degree in criminology, economics, health, political science, public policy, sociology or a related field, or equivalent experience


Experience working with large data sets, preferably in Stata, R or SAS, along with outstanding analytical ability


Strong programming skills: knowledge of Stata, SAS, R, Python or another statistical package is required


Excellent written and verbal communications skills


Must be comfortable working on teams, taking initiative, paying attention to detail, delivering high quality output in a timely manner, and working in an ever-evolving policy environment


Demonstrated interest in applied policy research and criminal justice policy is required, experience or interest in other policy areas is a plus




PPIC values the wide variety of backgrounds and experiences of our research staff, and key elements in the consideration of qualified candidates include excellence; diversity of talents, backgrounds, and viewpoints; and a strong fit with the institute’s mission, values, and goals.


To Apply


Applications will be considered as they are received, and the position will remain posted until filled. Please tailor your cover letter to highlight how your credentials meet the qualifications listed above.

PPIC is committed to excellence through diversity. Our work is rooted in objective, data-driven policy analysis. We welcome and encourage applicants who reflect the full diversity of California. The expertise of our staff members is essential to the success of PPIC’s mission, and we assist career and personal growth through robust support of skill development at all levels of the organization. We also provide a competitive package of benefits and financial compensation.

At DoorDash, our mission to empower local economies shapes how our team members move quickly and always learn and reiterate to support merchants, Dashers and the communities we serve. We are a technology and logistics company that started with door-to-door delivery, and we are looking for team members who can help us go from a company that is known for delivering food to a company that people turn to for any and all goods.



DoorDash is growing rapidly and changing constantly, which gives our team members the opportunity to share their unique perspectives, solve new challenges, and own their careers. Our leaders seek the truth and welcome big, hairy, audacious questions. We are grounded in our company values, and we make intentional decisions that are both logical and display empathy for our range of users—from Dashers to Merchants to Customers.



We're committed to supporting employees' happiness, healthiness, and overall well-being by providing comprehensive benefits and perks including premium healthcare, wellness expense reimbursement, paid parental leave and more.



Our Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion



We're committed to growing and empowering a more inclusive community within our company, industry, and cities. That's why we hire and cultivate diverse teams of people from all backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. We believe that true innovation happens when everyone has room at the table and the tools, resources, and opportunity to excel.

Above and beyond discrimination and harassment based on ""protected categories,"" we also strive to prevent other subtler forms of inappropriate behavior (i.e., stereotyping) from ever gaining a foothold in our office.

We value a diverse workforce – people who identify as women, non-binary or gender non-conforming, LGBTQIA+, American Indian or Native Alaskan, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, differently-abled, caretakers and parents, and veterans are strongly encouraged to apply.

Solving these problems is what helps our customers get back time in their day, so they can do more of what they love.
