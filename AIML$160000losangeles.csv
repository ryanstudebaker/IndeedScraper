Context: 
Every year companies are forced to reinvent interviews for the same ~100 professional roles, 500M times. Interviewing is slow, biased, lacks prediction, and candidates rarely get what they deserve.
Hireguide is a platform that lets hiring teams interview like experts for any role in minutes. We’re sharing what works from thousands of real questions, recordings and ratings, all analyzed by advanced natural language processing. For companies Hireguide makes interview preparation 20X faster, decisions twice as predictive and top candidates more likely to say yes. For candidates Hireguide delivers clearer interview instructions, a voice in the process, and actionable feedback. For society, Hireguide is a BCorp democratizing access to fairer interviewing.
The experience we offer: 
Develop skills on the cutting edge of AI tech, applying NLP / Conversational AI to Talent conversations
Work with industry “A-Players” - Eg CTO (PhD in AI) built the ML infrastructure for LinkedIn
Create a product, culture and business from the ground-up with true ownership
Establish true north customer value metrics and manage accelerating customer success
Learn to differentiate product through human centric design and ease of use
Hire and manage a large Product and Design team within a year
Mentoring by industry experts (including human centric design training)
Drive business hyper-growth, including early stage accountability and scaling
Solve a meaningful social problem by democratizing access to fairer more effective interviewing
The experience you offer: 
High EQ including a growth mindset, sharing credit, intense preparation, leading without authority
Experience capturing and prioritizing customer product requirements using multiple methods
Technical skills (eg a Computer Science background)
8-10 years experience building web based software from ideation, launch, to refinement (ideally: within AI / NLP, in HR, SaaS, B2B, 8+ years experience, managed others)
Balanced skill between 1) strategy and execution, 2) creativity and critical thinking, 3) customer and engineering empathy
Track record of accountability and results throughout lifetime (history of success)
Top seven skills under evaluation (ranked): 
1) Structured Problem Solving, 2) Product Management, 3) UX Design, 4) Coding Knowledge, 5) Agile 6) Managing Self 7) Managing Others
Total reward transparency: 
This role can be based anywhere in the US (preferred), Canada (preferred), UK/EU or Australia. Foundational hires are paid annual cash between $150-200k USD to maintain a comfortable lifestyle, but meaningful founding-team equity is the heart of the compensation upside. Founding team equity is expected to be worth multi-millions within a few years, potentially a lot more when we achieve our vision. We also offer competitive benefits, remote work, international offsites, four weeks vacation. Required to travel to California (Bay Area and/or Santa Monica) multiple times per year, health safety permitting.

MonoLets, Inc.
 is a full-stack provider of item-level asset identity and tracking technology. We enable this via disposable BLE digital labels at the cost of RFID tags, assembled within our proprietary low-power wireless mesh network architecture. Our system provides unmatched range, flexibility and cost-efficiency, and doesn't require expensive or proprietary infrastructure to collect, analyze and infer real-time data at scale. This finally makes it possible to cost-effectively access high-volume, high-velocity data at the item level on a global scale, and has applications in many different verticals, including real-time visibility into item location and/or temperature in logistics, retail, cold chain and pharmaceutical delivery. Our business model is data-as-a-service, using our low cost labels and mesh networks.
Our technology was developed at UC Berkeley over the last 4 years leveraging a $2M DARPA grant. We have finished three paid proof-of-concept trials with Fortune 500 companies, and have a queue of several large customers in logistics and manufacturing signed up for pilots. Our recently closed seed financing will fund these pilots and system commercialization.
We offer a comprehensive package of benefits, including flexible time off and flexible work location arrangements.
